Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither is clearly more effective overall—tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is noninferior to alteplase for acute ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours and appears superior for early reperfusion in large-vessel occlusion, so tenecteplase is preferred if an LVO is present while either agent is reasonable otherwise.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase and that either agent is reasonable within 4.5 hours, aligning with the guidelines. The added note about potential advantages in LVO does not contradict the reference."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV alteplase (tPA) immediately because he is within 4.5 hours of symptom onset with a disabling deficit (aphasia) and no hemorrhage on CT, after confirming BP <185/110 and no contraindications.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends immediate IV alteplase within the 4.5-hour window for a disabling deficit without hemorrhage, matching guidelines. They appropriately note standard eligibility checks and do not require advanced imaging selection."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer intravenous thrombolysis (alteplase) now, because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke suggests onset within the treatable window and his deficits are disabling despite a low NIHSS, with no hemorrhage on CT.",1.0,"CORRECT: DWI–FLAIR mismatch in a wake-up stroke supports eligibility for IV thrombolysis in the extended/unknown-onset window per guidelines. With no hemorrhage and disabling deficits despite a low NIHSS, administering alteplase now is appropriate."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Do not give IV alteplase because this is a minor, non-disabling isolated sensory deficit (NIHSS 1), and instead initiate antiplatelet therapy—preferably short-course dual therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel started promptly—along with standard stroke monitoring and secondary prevention.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly recommends against IV alteplase for a minor, non-disabling sensory stroke within 4.5 hours and advises initiating dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), consistent with guidelines."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport to the nearest primary stroke center for rapid CT and IV thrombolysis, then expedite transfer to the thrombectomy-capable center if large-vessel occlusion is confirmed, because although the high NIHSS suggests LVO the additional 45-minute bypass delay to the comprehensive center exceeds guideline thresholds and would unduly delay first reperfusion in this ultra-early window.",0.0,"WRONG: The reference answer addresses the lack of benefit of preoperative tirofiban before EVT, whereas the student's answer discusses transport destination strategy and does not address tirofiban at all. It does not contain the key factual information from the reference."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes—despite a large ischemic core and limited penumbral mismatch, current randomized trials (RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT) and guideline updates support endovascular thrombectomy for proximal M1 occlusion within 4 hours because it improves functional outcomes versus medical therapy, albeit with a higher hemorrhage risk.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student affirms that EVT can be performed despite a large ischemic core and cites appropriate trials showing benefit, aligning with the reference. Mention of higher hemorrhage risk does not contradict the core recommendation."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not give any adjuvant antithrombotic (antiplatelet or anticoagulant) within 24 hours of IV thrombolysis because it increases symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without proven benefit; instead obtain 24-hour brain imaging and, if no hemorrhage, start standard antiplatelet therapy (e.g., aspirin).",1.0,CORRECT: The student correctly states that adjuvant antithrombotic therapy should not be given with IV thrombolysis due to lack of proven benefit. Their recommendation to defer antithrombotics for 24 hours with follow-up imaging and then start aspirin if no hemorrhage is consistent with guidelines.
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?",Initiate insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose 140–180 mg/dL and maintain blood pressure below 180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after reperfusion—his current SBP 155–165 mm Hg needs no acute lowering—because these targets reduce hemorrhagic transformation and poor outcomes while avoiding hypoglycemia.,1.0,"CORRECT. The student rejects intensive glucose control (80–130 mg/dL) and targets 140–180 mg/dL, consistent with guidelines. They also correctly recommend maintaining BP <180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours post-reperfusion, with no acute lowering needed for SBP 155–165."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Given a 12-year-old with disabling acute ischemic stroke from a left M1 occlusion within 90 minutes and no hemorrhage, current AHA/ASA pediatric stroke guidance supports immediate IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg) followed by urgent mechanical thrombectomy at an experienced center without delaying thrombolysis, as both therapies are reasonable in selected children within standard time windows.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly notes that endovascular therapy (mechanical thrombectomy) is supported for select pediatric AIS with LVO at experienced centers. However, recommending immediate IV alteplase with adult dosing as standard in children overstates guideline support and adds potentially inaccurate details not reflected in the reference."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Deploy the mobile stroke unit, because its on-board CT and stroke team enable prehospital diagnosis and thrombolysis with faster reperfusion and improved 90-day functional outcomes compared with conventional EMS.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly recommends deploying the mobile stroke unit and accurately cites its advantages (on-board imaging, prehospital thrombolysis, faster treatment, and improved functional outcomes) consistent with guideline-supported benefits over conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No—do not initiate intravenous glibenclamide outside a clinical trial, because randomized trials (e.g., GAMES-RP and the phase 3 BIIB093/CHARM program) failed to show functional benefit in large hemispheric infarction, and current guidelines prioritize reperfusion when eligible, intensive edema monitoring/medical therapy, and timely decompressive hemicraniectomy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that IV glibenclamide should not be initiated due to lack of functional benefit in large hemispheric infarction, aligning with the guideline’s Class III (No Benefit) recommendation. Additional context about trials and alternative management does not contradict the reference."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Because she aspirates thin liquids on videofluoroscopy after stroke, guidelines recommend keeping her NPO except for an SLP-prescribed texture-modified diet (e.g., thickened liquids) with compensatory strategies, starting early enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube, using aspiration precautions and rigorous oral hygiene, providing swallow therapy with repeat instrumental reassessment, and reserving PEG placement for dysphagia expected to persist beyond about 2–3 weeks.",0.0,WRONG: The guideline recommendation specifically endorses pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk. The student omits PES and instead lists general dysphagia management measures not included in the reference answer.
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not use tirofiban routinely in this EVT candidate; instead reserve it only as a bailout during thrombectomy for problems like residual severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, re-occlusion/no‑reflow, or in-stent thrombosis because evidence of benefit is uncertain and hemorrhage risk—especially if IV thrombolysis is given—is a concern.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student advises against routine/preprocedural tirofiban use in an EVT candidate, aligning with Class III (No Benefit). Their mention of possible bailout use does not contradict the guideline statement about preoperative administration not improving outcomes."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Proceed with emergent CT/CTA to confirm basilar artery occlusion and take him directly for endovascular thrombectomy, as he has a severe posterior circulation stroke (NIHSS 18) with favorable imaging (pc-ASPECTS 7) and is beyond the 4.5-hour IV thrombolysis window but within the 0–24-hour window where thrombectomy improves outcomes.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends endovascular thrombectomy within the 24-hour window for suspected basilar artery occlusion with NIHSS ≥10 and PC-ASPECTS ≥6, matching the guideline. Mentioning confirmatory imaging and being beyond the IV thrombolysis window is appropriate and does not contradict the recommendation."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy now with aspirin and clopidogrel (give loading doses, then aspirin 81 mg plus clopidogrel 75 mg daily) for 21 days because she has a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke within 24 hours and symptomatic carotid stenosis, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy (preferably clopidogrel) thereafter while expediting carotid revascularization.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends starting aspirin plus clopidogrel now for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy in a minor noncardioembolic stroke with symptomatic carotid stenosis and no thrombolysis, which matches the reference. Extra details (loading doses, SAPT choice, revascularization) do not contradict the guidance."
