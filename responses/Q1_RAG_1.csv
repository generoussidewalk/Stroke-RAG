Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?",Neither is clearly more effective; current guidelines recommend either tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg within 4.5 hours because tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase for functional outcomes with similar safety.
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis now (e.g., alteplase per protocol) because he is within the 4.5-hour window and has a clearly disabling aphasia despite a low NIHSS and no hemorrhage on CT."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis now (alteplase or tenecteplase), because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke identifies him as eligible for extended-window IVT and his deficits (neglect/weakness) are clearly disabling despite a low NIHSS after hemorrhage has been excluded."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Do not give IV thrombolysis because her isolated hemisensory deficit (NIHSS 1) is not clearly disabling, and instead initiate early dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy, with routine stroke unit monitoring."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearest primary stroke center (10 minutes away) for rapid imaging and IV thrombolysis with immediate prenotified transfer for EVT if LVO is confirmed, because guidelines favor the closest appropriate facility and trials (e.g., RACECAT) show no outcome benefit to bypassing a thrombolysis-capable hospital for a thrombectomy-capable center 45–60 minutes farther, with potential delays and lower IVT use."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, because in the 0–6 hour window EVT is recommended for ICA/M1 LVO with NIHSS ≥6 and ASPECTS 3–10 and is reasonable even with ASPECTS 0–2 in patients <80 without significant mass effect, so despite a large core she remains an EVT candidate, albeit with potentially attenuated benefit if severe CT hypodensity is extensive."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Withhold any adjuvant antithrombotic during and for the first 24 hours after IV thrombolysis and initiate aspirin only after a 24-hour CT/MRI excludes hemorrhage, because adjunctive agents (e.g., aspirin early, eptifibatide, abciximab, tirofiban) have no proven functional benefit and increase or risk hemorrhage."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Maintain blood glucose with standard, nonintensive control (aim roughly 140–180 mg/dL using insulin as needed and avoid targeting 80–130 mg/dL) because intensive control has not improved outcomes and risks hypoglycemia, and manage blood pressure by simply keeping SBP <180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after IV thrombolysis (and avoid intensive reduction to <140 mm Hg—including after successful EVT—since this does not improve outcomes and may be harmful)."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Because this 12-year-old presents within 90 minutes with disabling deficits and a CTA-confirmed M1 large-vessel occlusion, current AHA/ASA pediatric guidance supports consideration of IV alteplase within 4.5 hours and urgent endovascular thrombectomy within 6 hours by experienced pediatric neurointerventionalists, as EVT in children ≥6 years improves outcomes while alteplase appears safe though efficacy is uncertain."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Deploy the Mobile Stroke Unit, because guidelines recommend MSUs over conventional EMS for suspected thrombolysis-eligible stroke as they enable on-scene imaging and ultra-early IV thrombolysis, improving treatment times and 90-day functional outcomes without added safety risk."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No; intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated because in large hemispheric infarction (as indicated by >50% MCA territory involvement) randomized evidence shows no improvement in 90-day functional outcomes or mortality, and guidelines explicitly do not recommend it in patients aged 18–70 years."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Manage her dysphagia with SLP-directed therapy using texture/viscosity modification and compensatory strategies plus strict aspiration precautions and an oral hygiene protocol, initiate enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube within 7 days with validated nutritional screening preferably within 48 hours (avoiding early PEG and reserving gastrostomy if safe swallowing is unlikely to recover within >2–3 weeks), consider pharyngeal electrical stimulation to reduce dysphagia/aspiration, and reassess swallowing periodically with instrumental studies, because these steps minimize pneumonia and aspiration risk while ensuring adequate nutrition and hydration per current stroke guidelines."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not administer preprocedural tirofiban, because guideline Recommendation 14 and the RESCUE-BT trial show no improvement in 90-day functional outcomes and a potential increase in intracranial hemorrhage risk; proceed with EVT (and IV thrombolysis if eligible) without routine tirofiban."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","He should undergo emergent endovascular thrombectomy for suspected basilar artery occlusion because at 6 hours from onset with NIHSS 18, PC-ASPECTS 7, and baseline mRS 0, guideline recommendations support EVT within 24 hours to improve outcomes and reduce mortality, whereas IV thrombolysis is not indicated beyond 4.5 hours."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel now for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy, because she has minor noncardioembolic AIS within 24 hours without IV thrombolysis and short-term DAPT reduces 90-day recurrent stroke risk."
