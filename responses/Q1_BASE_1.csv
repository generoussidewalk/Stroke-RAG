Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither is clearly more effective overall: tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is noninferior to alteplase for functional outcomes within 4.5 hours and provides better early reperfusion in large-vessel occlusion with single-bolus dosing, so it is preferred when LVO/thrombectomy is suspected, while either agent is acceptable otherwise."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis now (e.g., alteplase per protocol) because he presents within 4.5 hours with a disabling ischemic deficit and no hemorrhage on CT, and treatment should not be delayed by low NIHSS or additional imaging."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer intravenous alteplase now, because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke indicates onset within the treatable window and, with disabling deficits and no hemorrhage, he meets criteria for thrombolysis despite a 10-hour last-known-well."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Because this is a minor, non-disabling ischemic stroke (isolated sensory loss with NIHSS 1) within 2 hours, IV alteplase is not recommended; instead initiate antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, and consider short-course dual antiplatelet if eligible) with standard monitoring and stroke workup."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearby primary stroke center for immediate IV thrombolysis with rapid transfer if LVO is confirmed, because the 45-minute additional transport time to a thrombectomy-capable center would unduly delay reperfusion and current guidelines favor bypass only when the added time is modest (about ≤30 minutes)."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes—despite a large core, recent randomized trials (RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT) support performing endovascular thrombectomy for proximal M1 occlusion with disabling deficits within this time window even without substantial perfusion mismatch, though the expected benefit is smaller and hemorrhagic risk is higher."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not add any adjuvant antithrombotic agent during the first 24 hours after IV thrombolysis; instead withhold antiplatelets/anticoagulants, obtain 24-hour brain imaging, and then start aspirin if no hemorrhage, because early antithrombotic therapy increases symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without proven benefit."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Per current AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, treat hyperglycemia with insulin to maintain glucose 140–180 mg/dL (avoid tighter control to prevent hypoglycemia) and keep blood pressure below 180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after reperfusion—so no additional BP lowering is needed with his 155–165 mm Hg systolic."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Because IV alteplase is generally not recommended in children under 18 outside specialized protocols, this 12-year-old with a disabling acute M1 occlusion within 90 minutes should be urgently managed with endovascular mechanical thrombectomy at a pediatric stroke center, with antiplatelet therapy and standard supportive care if thrombectomy is unavailable or after reperfusion."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Deploy the mobile stroke unit, because its on-scene CT and stroke expertise enable earlier thrombolysis and thrombectomy triage, reducing time to reperfusion and improving functional outcomes compared with conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated outside a clinical trial because phase 2 signals did not translate into improved functional outcomes and the phase 3 CHARM trial was negative, so care should focus on close edema monitoring and early decompressive hemicraniectomy consideration in this high-risk patient."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Manage her by keeping her NPO for unsafe consistencies and providing only SLP-guided texture-modified solids and thickened liquids with compensatory strategies, initiating early enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube with strict oral hygiene and aspiration precautions, and if safe oral intake does not recover after about 2–3 weeks, considering PEG placement, to minimize aspiration risk and maintain adequate nutrition per stroke guidelines."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not administer tirofiban routinely in this EVT candidate because current evidence and guidelines do not support GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors and they increase hemorrhage risk (especially if IV thrombolysis is given), reserving only carefully dosed intraprocedural rescue use for issues like refractory in-stent thrombosis or severe residual stenosis after emergent stenting."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Because he presents 6 hours after onset with severe, disabling posterior-circulation stroke and a favorable PC-ASPECTS (7), he should undergo emergent vascular imaging and, if basilar artery occlusion is confirmed, proceed to endovascular thrombectomy (effective up to 24 hours) rather than IV thrombolysis, which is now outside the 4.5-hour window."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Start dual antiplatelet therapy now with aspirin (160–325 mg load, then 81 mg daily) plus clopidogrel (300 mg load, then 75 mg daily) for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy, because early short-course DAPT after a minor noncardioembolic stroke within 24 hours—especially with symptomatic carotid stenosis—reduces early recurrence whereas prolonged DAPT increases bleeding."
