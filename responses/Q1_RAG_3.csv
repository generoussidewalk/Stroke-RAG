Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither agent is more effective overall because randomized trials show tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is noninferior to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg with similar safety, so either is recommended within 4.5 hours, with tenecteplase often favored for single-bolus convenience."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis (e.g., alteplase or tenecteplase) now because he is within 4.5 hours of onset with a clearly disabling aphasia and no hemorrhage on CT, for which thrombolysis is recommended despite a low NIHSS."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis (e.g., alteplase) now because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke indicates recent onset without established infarction, and with disabling deficits and no hemorrhage he meets extended-window IVT eligibility."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Because this is a minor, non-disabling ischemic stroke (isolated hemisensory loss, NIHSS 1) within 2 hours and CT negative, IV thrombolysis is not recommended, and she should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy to reduce early recurrent stroke risk."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearest primary stroke center (10 minutes away) with EMS prenotification for immediate imaging and IV thrombolysis and activation of rapid transfer if LVO is identified, because bypassing to a thrombectomy-capable center 55 minutes away has not improved outcomes and can reduce IVT use in well-coordinated systems."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, EVT can still be performed because in the 0–6-hour window it is recommended for ASPECTS 3–10 and is reasonable for ASPECTS 0–2 in patients under 80 without significant mass effect, so this 72-year-old with an M1 occlusion remains eligible despite a large core."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not add any adjunctive antithrombotic during or immediately after IV thrombolysis and instead obtain a 24-hour CT and then start aspirin if no hemorrhage, because adjunct agents (eptifibatide/abciximab/argatroban) show no benefit with increased bleeding/mortality and early antiplatelet use with IVT raises hemorrhage risk."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Treat his hyperglycemia with moderate control (e.g., subcutaneous insulin to target glucose about 140–180 mg/dL) and avoid tight IV insulin targets of 80–130 mg/dL because intensive control has not improved outcomes and risks hypoglycemia, and manage blood pressure by maintaining SBP <180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after IV thrombolysis (and ≤185/110 mm Hg around EVT) while avoiding intensive reduction to <140 mm Hg after successful EVT since it is harmful, so his current SBP of 155–165 mm Hg is acceptable without aggressive lowering."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Because he is ≥6 years with disabling AIS from a left M1 large-vessel occlusion within 6 hours, he should undergo emergent endovascular thrombectomy by an experienced neurointerventionalist, and IV alteplase within 4.5 hours may be considered after contraindication screening (evidence in children is limited) but must not delay EVT."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Use the mobile stroke unit, because randomized studies show MSUs enable on‑scene imaging and treatment, achieve faster thrombolysis (especially within the golden hour), and improve 90‑day functional outcomes without added safety risk compared with conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No—do not start IV glibenclamide, because in patients 18–70 years with large hemispheric infarction (e.g., >50% MCA territory/low ASPECTS) it did not improve functional outcomes or mortality in RCTs (CHARM) and is not recommended by current guidelines."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Per current AIS guidelines, manage her confirmed aspiration risk with SLP-directed dysphagia therapy that restricts unsafe consistencies (eg, avoid thin liquids) and uses compensatory strategies, implement a strict oral-hygiene protocol, begin early enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube within 7 days (reserving PEG only if safe swallowing is unlikely to recover for >2–3 weeks), consider pharyngeal electrical stimulation, and reassess with instrumented studies as needed, because these steps reduce aspiration/pneumonia and optimize recovery."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not administer tirofiban before EVT in this LVO patient, because guideline Recommendation 14 and the RESCUE-BT trial show no improvement in 90-day functional outcomes and meta-analyses suggest higher intracranial hemorrhage risk, so proceed with IVT (if eligible) and rapid thrombectomy without adjunctive tirofiban."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Obtain emergent vascular imaging (CTA/MRA) and, if basilar artery occlusion is confirmed, proceed immediately with endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours because with baseline mRS 0, NIHSS 18, and PC-ASPECTS 7 he meets guideline criteria showing EVT improves outcomes and reduces mortality, while he is beyond the IV thrombolysis window."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Start dual antiplatelet therapy now with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy, because she has a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke within 24 hours without IV thrombolysis and short-term DAPT lowers early recurrent stroke risk (CHANCE/POINT; COR 1, LOE A), with ticagrelor plus aspirin a reasonable alternative if a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele is present."
