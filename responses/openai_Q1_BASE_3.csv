Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither is clearly more effective overall, as tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg is noninferior to alteplase for functional outcomes within 4.5 hours and may provide better early reperfusion in large-vessel occlusion while offering simpler single-bolus administration, so either is appropriate per local protocol."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?",Administer intravenous alteplase now (after ensuring no contraindications and blood pressure <185/110) because he is within 3 hours of onset with a disabling ischemic stroke (aphasia) and no hemorrhage on CT.
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV alteplase now because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke indicates onset likely within 4.5 hours and, despite an NIHSS of 4, his weakness and neglect are disabling and there is no intracranial hemorrhage."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Because she has an isolated, non-disabling sensory deficit (NIHSS 1) within 2 hours and no hemorrhage, IV thrombolysis is not recommended, so initiate antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, with short-course aspirin–clopidogrel if no contraindication) and proceed with standard stroke evaluation and secondary prevention."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearest primary stroke center for immediate imaging and IV thrombolysis with rapid transfer for thrombectomy if large-vessel occlusion is confirmed, because the additional 45-minute delay to the thrombectomy-capable center exceeds guideline thresholds for bypass and would substantially delay time-sensitive reperfusion therapy."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes—despite the large ischemic core and limited penumbra, endovascular thrombectomy is reasonable because contemporary trials (RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT) show functional benefit for proximal M1 occlusions even without perfusion mismatch within this time window, though with higher hemorrhage risk."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not add any adjuvant antithrombotic therapy; withhold antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents for 24 hours after IV thrombolysis and only start aspirin after a 24-hour CT confirms no hemorrhage, because early antithrombotics increase symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without improving outcomes."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Treat hyperglycemia with insulin to target glucose 140–180 mg/dL (treat readings >180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia), and after reperfusion therapy maintain blood pressure <180/105 mm Hg for 24 hours—his current SBP 155–165 mm Hg meets this goal and should not be lowered aggressively to avoid reducing cerebral perfusion."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Because this 12-year-old has a disabling anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion within 90 minutes and no hemorrhage, he should receive IV alteplase 0.9 mg/kg (max 90 mg; 10% bolus then 60-minute infusion) after pediatric stroke-expert consultation and contraindication screening, with simultaneous activation for urgent mechanical thrombectomy of the left M1 (do not delay transfer/EVT; ideally within 6 hours, using bridging IVT), as recommended by current AHA/ASA pediatric AIS guidance."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"The mobile stroke unit is preferred because it can obtain on‑scene brain imaging with telestroke evaluation to initiate IV thrombolysis and triage for thrombectomy more rapidly than conventional EMS, reducing time to treatment and improving functional outcomes."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated outside a clinical trial because phase 3 randomized data in large hemispheric infarction failed to show functional benefit and guidelines do not recommend it, and this patient instead warrants neurocritical care with early consideration of decompressive hemicraniectomy given age under 60 and >50% MCA territory involvement."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Given videofluoroscopic aspiration of thin liquids after stroke, guideline-concordant care is to restrict oral intake to speech–language pathologist–recommended consistencies (e.g., thickened liquids/texture‑modified solids) with compensatory strategies and upright positioning plus meticulous oral hygiene to reduce aspiration risk, initiate early enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube if safe oral intake is not possible or insufficient, defer PEG placement unless dysphagia persists beyond about 2–3 weeks, and reassess swallowing periodically."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not administer tirofiban routinely in this likely cardioembolic M1 occlusion undergoing EVT; instead reserve it only as a bail-out (e.g., in-stent thrombosis or severe underlying intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis with re-occlusion) because glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors have no proven benefit and increase symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage risk, particularly if IV thrombolysis is given."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Obtain emergent CTA and, if basilar artery occlusion is confirmed, proceed urgently to mechanical thrombectomy given disabling posterior-circulation stroke 6 hours from onset with favorable PC-ASPECTS (7) and high NIHSS (18), while not giving IV thrombolysis because he is beyond the 4.5-hour window."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Initiate short-term dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel now (load then continue for 21 days) because she has a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke within 24 hours and symptomatic carotid stenosis, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy thereafter while expediting carotid revascularization."
