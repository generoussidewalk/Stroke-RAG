Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither is clearly more effective overall, as tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg has been shown to be noninferior to alteplase 0.9 mg/kg with similar safety within 4.5 hours of onset, so either is appropriate and selection can be based on logistics and availability."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis now (e.g., tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus or alteplase 0.9 mg/kg after ensuring BP <185/110 and no contraindications), because he is within 4.5 hours of onset with a clearly disabling deficit (aphasia) and no hemorrhage on CT."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV alteplase now, because the DWI-positive/FLAIR-negative “wake-up” pattern indicates a recent ischemic stroke with disabling deficits (neglect) and no hemorrhage, meeting imaging-based extended-window thrombolysis criteria despite an NIHSS of 4."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Do not give IV thrombolysis because her isolated hemisensory deficit (NIHSS 1) is non-disabling, and instead start early dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy to reduce early recurrent stroke risk."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearest primary stroke center with EMS prenotification for immediate IV thrombolysis and rapid evaluation/transfer for EVT if LVO is confirmed, because bypassing a capable local center to a thrombectomy center 55 minutes away has not shown outcome benefit and risks delaying time-sensitive reperfusion."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes—EVT can be performed because in the 0–6-hour window an anterior-circulation M1 LVO with NIHSS ≥6 warrants thrombectomy, with EVT recommended for ASPECTS 3–10 and reasonable even for ASPECTS 0–2 in selected patients without significant mass effect, though benefit may be attenuated with very large severe hypodensity cores."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not add any adjunctive antithrombotic during/soon after IV thrombolysis and withhold antiplatelets for 24 hours with aspirin started only after repeat imaging excludes hemorrhage, because randomized trials of agents such as eptifibatide, argatroban, abciximab, and tirofiban show no functional benefit and increased bleeding/mortality and guidelines advise against early antiplatelet use with IVT."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Per current AIS guidelines, treat his hyperglycemia with moderate control—initiate insulin to keep glucose roughly 140–180 mg/dL and avoid hypoglycemia since tight IV insulin targets of 80–130 mg/dL do not improve outcomes—and manage blood pressure by maintaining SBP <180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after IV thrombolysis and avoiding intensive lowering to <140 mm Hg even after successful endovascular therapy, so his current SBP of 155–165 mm Hg is acceptable without aggressive reduction unless another indication exists."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Urgently take him for endovascular thrombectomy by an experienced pediatric-capable neurointerventional team and consider bridging IV alteplase within 4.5 hours, because in children ≥6 years with anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion EVT improves outcomes and IV thrombolysis may be safely considered though its efficacy is uncertain."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Deploy the Mobile Stroke Unit, because randomized trials and meta-analyses show MSUs expedite imaging and thrombolysis (especially within the golden hour), increase reperfusion treatment rates, improve 90-day functional outcomes, and enable accurate triage without added safety concerns compared with conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated because in large hemispheric infarction it has not improved 90-day functional outcomes or mortality in randomized trials (e.g., CHARM) and is not recommended by current guidelines."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Manage her dysphagia by restricting unsafe consistencies and implementing SLP-directed therapy with texture-modified diet (e.g., thickened liquids) and supervised feeding, instituting an oral hygiene protocol, performing early nutritional screening and starting enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube within 7 days if oral intake is unsafe or inadequate (with percutaneous gastrostomy considered if safe swallowing is unlikely to return in >2–3 weeks), and considering pharyngeal electrical stimulation to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk, because current stroke guidelines recommend structured screening/assessment, early enteral support, NG feeding before PEG, oral hygiene, and PES for dysphagia after stroke."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not give preprocedural tirofiban and proceed directly to EVT without delay, because evidence (e.g., RESCUE-BT) shows no 90-day functional benefit and possible higher hemorrhage risk, reserving glycoprotein IIb/IIIa agents only for specific rescue scenarios such as emergent stenting if absolutely necessary."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Proceed with urgent endovascular thrombectomy (after confirming basilar artery occlusion on vascular imaging), because with symptom onset 6 hours ago, NIHSS 18, PC-ASPECTS 7, and baseline mRS 0 he meets guideline criteria (mRS 0–1, NIHSS ≥10, PC-ASPECTS ≥6, ≤24 hours) for EVT to improve outcomes and reduce mortality, and he is beyond the usual IV thrombolysis window."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Initiate dual antiplatelet therapy now with aspirin plus clopidogrel (load then 21 days of DAPT followed by single antiplatelet therapy) because she has a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke within 24 hours without IV thrombolysis where short-course DAPT reduces early recurrence (Class I, Level A), with ticagrelor plus aspirin as a reasonable alternative if a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele is present."
