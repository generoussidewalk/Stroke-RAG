Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","According to the 2026 AHA/ASA guideline, in adult patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, tenecteplase at 0.25 mg/kg (max 25 mg) or alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg are both recommended to improve functional outcomes, as multiple large phase 3 randomized controlled trials have demonstrated noninferiority of tenecteplase compared to alteplase with similar safety profiles, meaning neither agent has been proven more effective than the other, though tenecteplase offers practical advantages such as single-bolus administration.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase and that either agent is recommended within the 4.5-hour window, noting no proven superiority—matching the reference guidance."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) as quickly as possible, because the guidelines recommend that in adult patients with acute ischemic stroke and disabling deficits—regardless of NIHSS score—who are eligible for IVT within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, treatment should be initiated without delay, and this patient's severe aphasia (≥2 on the NIHSS ""best language"" question) qualifies as a clearly disabling deficit per Table 4, he is within the 4.5-hour treatment window at 90 minutes, and noncontrast head CT has already excluded intracranial hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends immediate IV thrombolysis within the 4.5-hour window for a disabling deficit after excluding hemorrhage on noncontrast CT. This aligns with guidelines and the reference answer, which advocate rapid thrombolysis without need for advanced imaging selection."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Based on the clinical scenario, this patient has a wake-up stroke with last known well approximately 10 hours ago, an NIHSS score of 4, and crucially demonstrates a DWI-FLAIR mismatch on MRI (restricted diffusion on DWI without corresponding FLAIR signal change), which suggests the ischemic injury is likely within the 4.5-hour window despite the unknown exact onset time. According to Recommendation 7, in patients with suspected AIS who awaken with symptoms or have an unknown time of onset 4.5 to 24 hours from last known well, CTP or MR DWI-PWI selection with automated postprocessing software analysis can be useful to determine eligibility for extended window IV thrombolysis (IVT), and additionally Recommendation 9 states that MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch can be useful in evaluation for EVT if a large vessel occlusion is present; therefore, the most appropriate next step is to use the DWI-FLAIR mismatch finding to support eligibility for IV thrombolysis in the extended window, provided the deficits are clearly disabling — however, since this patient's NIHSS is 4, the clinician should carefully assess whether the deficits (left-sided weakness and neglect) are clearly disabling per Table 4 guidance (where severe hemi-attention/extinction ≥2 on NIHSS and any weakness limiting sustained effort against gravity ≥2 would be considered clearly disabling), and if so, proceed with IV thrombolysis while also obtaining vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) to evaluate for large vessel occlusion that might warrant endovascular thrombectomy.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly identifies DWI–FLAIR mismatch as supporting eligibility for IV thrombolysis despite unknown onset and suggests proceeding if deficits are disabling. However, they incorrectly extend the IV thrombolysis window to 24 hours and conflate DWI–FLAIR mismatch with EVT selection, which is not guideline-based."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Based on the guidelines, this patient presents with a minor noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score of 1) with isolated hemisensory loss—a deficit that ""may not be clearly disabling in an individual patient"" per Table 4—and since she did not receive IV thrombolysis, the recommended course of treatment is to initiate dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) early (such as aspirin plus clopidogrel) and continue it for 21 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), as this is a Class 1, Level of Evidence A recommendation (Recommendation 12) shown to reduce the 90-day risk of recurrent stroke in patients with minor noncardioembolic AIS or high-risk TIA who did not receive IVT.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends withholding IV thrombolysis for a nondisabling minor stroke and initiating early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), consistent with guideline-supported management."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Based on the 2026 AHA guideline, this patient with suspected large vessel occlusion (NIHSS 14, right-sided weakness, and aphasia) should be transported to the local primary stroke center (PSC) 10 minutes away for rapid evaluation and initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, with subsequent interhospital transfer to the thrombectomy-capable center if needed, because the RACECAT trial and TRIAGE-STROKE trial demonstrated that in areas with well-coordinated systems of stroke care and local hospitals proficient in thrombolysis delivery, direct transport of patients with suspected LVO to a distant thrombectomy center approximately 45–60 minutes away does not improve 3-month clinical outcomes compared to transport to a local stroke center (Recommendation 4, Class 3: No Benefit), and the guideline further recommends that hospitals and EMS professionals establish agreements and protocols to prioritize interhospital transfer of patients needing a higher level of care to reduce door-in–door-out times (Recommendation 5), while EMS should provide advance notification to the receiving PSC to reduce in-hospital evaluation times, increase thrombolytic use, and decrease mortality (Prehospital Recommendation 3, Class 1).",0.0,"WRONG: The reference answer addresses tirofiban use before EVT (no benefit), whereas the student’s answer discusses prehospital transport strategy and does not mention tirofiban. It fails to include the key factual point from the reference."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, endovascular thrombectomy can still be performed because according to the 2026 guidelines, EVT is recommended for patients presenting within 0 to 6 hours with anterior circulation proximal LVO of the ICA or M1, NIHSS score ≥6, prestroke mRS 0–1, and ASPECTS as low as 3–10 (Recommendation 1/9), and even for ASPECTS 0–2 EVT is considered reasonable in selected patients aged <80 years without significant mass effect (Recommendation 4/11), so this 72-year-old patient with an NIHSS of 19 and M1 occlusion at 4 hours would be eligible for EVT even with a large ischemic core, provided there is no significant mass effect and her prestroke functional status was good, though the treating team should be aware that CT hypodensity volumes ≥26 mL of severe hypodensity (≤26 Hounsfield units) have been associated with diminished treatment benefit and increased risks including cerebral edema and need for hemicraniectomy.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly states that EVT can be performed in selected patients with large ischemic cores. However, they cite speculative “2026 guidelines” and provide questionable specific criteria (e.g., EVT for ASPECTS 0–2) not supported by the reference, introducing inaccuracies."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Based on the provided guidelines, the most appropriate management decision is to **not** administer any adjunctive antithrombotic agent concurrently or within the early post-thrombolysis period, because Recommendation 17 states that IV aspirin should not be administered concurrently or within 90 minutes after the start of IVT due to the risk of hemorrhage (COR 3: Harm, LOE B-R), Recommendation 18 states that adjunctive treatment with IV eptifibatide is not recommended to reduce disability at 3 months in patients treated with IVT within 3 hours (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-R), and the MOST trial demonstrated that adjunctive IV argatroban and eptifibatide did not reduce post-stroke disability but were associated with increased 90-day mortality, while Recommendation 2 notes that the risk of antiplatelet therapy in the first 24 hours after IVT is uncertain and many clinicians appropriately delay aspirin administration until 24 hours after fibrinolysis or once imaging has ruled out intracranial bleeding.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly states that adjunctive antithrombotic therapy (e.g., eptifibatide, argatroban) with IV thrombolysis is not recommended due to lack of benefit and potential harm. Their added details about avoiding early aspirin and citing relevant trial data are consistent with guidelines and do not contradict the reference answer."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Based on current 2026 AIS guidelines, this patient's hyperglycemia should **not** be treated with intensive IV insulin targeting 80–130 mg/dL, as Recommendation 5 states that in hospitalized AIS patients with hyperglycemia, IV insulin to achieve blood glucose levels of 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended to improve 3-month functional outcomes; however, blood glucose should still be monitored and reasonably managed (with the ideal intensity and timing relative to reperfusion therapy remaining a knowledge gap), and regarding blood pressure, since he received intravenous thrombolysis his BP should be maintained below 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours post-IVT (which his current systolic range of 155–165 mmHg satisfies), while intensive SBP reduction to a target of <140 mmHg is explicitly not recommended per Recommendation 3, as it does not improve functional outcomes in patients with mild to moderate severity AIS treated with IVT.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly states that intensive glucose control targeting 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended in AIS patients. Although they do not mention hypoglycemia risk explicitly, the key management recommendation from the guideline is captured."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to current guidelines, this 12-year-old boy with confirmed acute ischemic stroke due to left MCA M1 occlusion presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset should be managed with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) performed by experienced neurointerventionalists to improve functional outcomes (COR 2a for patients ≥6 years with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours), and IV thrombolysis with alteplase may also be considered (COR 2b for pediatric patients aged 28 days to 18 years with confirmed AIS within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, though efficacy is uncertain), making EVT the more strongly recommended intervention given the confirmed large vessel occlusion and his age and clinical severity.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies endovascular thrombectomy as the recommended management for select pediatric AIS with large-vessel occlusion, aligning with the guideline emphasis on interventional treatment. The added note that IV thrombolysis may be considered does not contradict the reference and is reasonable given current guidance."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Based on the guidelines, a mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred because MSUs have been shown to improve functional outcomes at 90 days, reduce onset-to-treatment times, increase the proportion of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis within the critical golden hour, and achieve significantly faster thrombolysis compared to conventional EMS care, with no identified safety concerns regarding all-cause mortality, stroke mimics treated with IVT, or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies the MSU as the preferred service when available and provides supporting benefits consistent with guidelines, including faster treatment and improved outcomes without new safety concerns."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated, because the CHARM trial demonstrated that IV glibenclamide did not result in improved functional outcome (mRS score at 90 days) or reduced 90-day mortality in patients with large hemispheric infarction at risk for cerebral edema, and the 2026 guideline explicitly states that in patients with large hemispheric infarction aged 18 to 70 years, the use of IV glibenclamide is not recommended (Recommendation 18).",1.0,CORRECT: The student accurately states that IV glibenclamide is not recommended (Class III: No Benefit) for large hemispheric infarction in adults 18–70 because it does not improve functional outcomes. This aligns with the reference recommendation.
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","According to current stroke guidelines, this patient's dysphagia should be managed through a multimodal approach: first, a bedside swallow screening should have been performed prior to any oral intake (which was done), and given the confirmed moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration on videofluoroscopic study, oral intake of thin liquids should be restricted and diet texture modified accordingly; enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube should be initiated within the first 7 days if she cannot swallow safely, with consideration of percutaneous gastrostomy if the inability to swallow safely is anticipated to last longer than 2–3 weeks; pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) can be beneficial to reduce dysphagia severity and decrease aspiration risk (Recommendation 17, COR 2a); an oral hygiene protocol should be implemented to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia; nutritional screening using validated tools should be performed preferably within 48 hours of admission to guide nutritional management; and a formal interdisciplinary rehabilitation assessment, including speech-language pathology involvement, should be provided to optimize her functional recovery.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student explicitly includes pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) as beneficial with COR 2a, matching the reference answer. Additional details do not contradict the guideline statement."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Based on the 2026 AHA/ASA guideline (Recommendation 14), preoperative administration of tirofiban before EVT is not useful to improve 90-day functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the setting of large vessel occlusion, so tirofiban should not be given to this patient prior to his endovascular thrombectomy, as the RESCUE-BT trial found no functional benefit from IV preoperative tirofiban in LVO prior to EVT, and a meta-analysis further indicated that while IV tirofiban was associated with better 90-day functional outcomes in some analyses, it also carried a higher incidence of intracranial hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly states that preoperative tirofiban before EVT is not useful and should not be given, matching COR 3: No Benefit. Extra trial/meta-analysis commentary does not change the correct recommendation."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Based on the 2026 guidelines, this patient with acute ischemic stroke due to presumed basilar artery occlusion—presenting within 24 hours of symptom onset with a baseline mRS score of 0 (meeting the 0–1 criterion), an NIHSS score of 18 (≥10), and a PC-ASPECTS of 7 (≥6)—meets the criteria outlined in Recommendation 13, and therefore endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is recommended to achieve better functional outcomes and reduce mortality, using stent retrievers, contact aspiration, or combination techniques to achieve rapid reperfusion to an extended TICI grade of 2b/2c/3 as early as possible within the therapeutic window.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies that this patient with presumed basilar artery occlusion, NIHSS ≥10, PC-ASPECTS ≥6, and onset within 24 hours meets criteria for EVT to improve outcomes and reduce mortality. Additional technique details do not contradict the recommendation."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient presents with a minor noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score of 3, ≤3) who did not receive intravenous thrombolysis, and per Recommendation 12 (COR 1, LOE A), she should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin early—within 24 hours of symptom onset—and continued for 21 days, after which she should be transitioned to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) for long-term secondary prevention, as this regimen was established by the CHANCE and POINT trials to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with minor noncardioembolic AIS or high-risk TIA compared to aspirin alone; additionally, given that she presented at 18 hours from onset (within the 24-hour window), she falls within the optimal treatment window, and if there were concern about CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele status, ticagrelor plus aspirin for 21 days could also be considered per Recommendation 15 (COR 2b, LOE B-R), though the standard first-line DAPT regimen remains clopidogrel plus aspirin.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends DAPT with clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 days followed by SAPT in a minor, noncardioembolic stroke with significant carotid stenosis and no IVT, which aligns with the guideline. Although they mislabel the class of recommendation, the management plan and timing are appropriate for this case."
