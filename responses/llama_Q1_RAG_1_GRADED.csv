Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Intravenous tenecteplase at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg body weight (maximum 25 mg) is recommended as it has shown similar efficacy and safety profiles to alteplase in various trials, including the MOST trial, with potential advantages due to its higher fibrin specificity and favorable pharmacokinetics.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly notes similar efficacy/safety and potential practical advantages of tenecteplase, but they recommend tenecteplase, whereas guidelines endorse either alteplase or tenecteplase within 4.5 hours without superiority. The specific trial citation is also questionable."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administration of IV alteplase for thrombolysis is recommended given the patient's disabling deficits and eligibility within 4.5 hours from symptom onset, despite his NIHSS score being below the threshold for IVT in some guidelines, subjective considerations must be taken into account to guide patient selection.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends IV alteplase for a disabling deficit within 4.5 hours, aligning with guideline-based thrombolysis without requiring advanced imaging. The note about low NIHSS not precluding treatment is consistent with the reference."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the right middle cerebral artery territory, making him eligible for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). Given his NIHSS score of 4 and time from last known well of approximately 10 hours, EVT should be considered to improve functional outcomes.",0.0,"WRONG: The DWI-FLAIR mismatch supports extended-window IV thrombolysis for stroke of unknown onset, not primary EVT. The student assumes an LVO without vascular imaging and does not recommend thrombolysis, which contradicts the guideline-based next step."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","The patient meets the criteria for minor noncardioembolic AIS with an NIHSS score ≤3, and therefore, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) should be initiated early and continued for 21 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies this as a minor, non-disabling ischemic stroke and recommends early dual antiplatelet therapy, which aligns with guidelines that favor DAPT over thrombolysis in this setting. The suggested 21-day duration followed by single antiplatelet therapy is consistent with standard practice."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","In this patient, given the proximity of the primary stroke center (PSC) to the scene and its ability to provide timely thrombolysis, direct transport to the PSC would be reasonable for acute ischemic stroke management, despite the availability of a more distant comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center.",0.0,"WRONG: The reference answer addresses the lack of benefit of preoperative tirofiban before EVT (COR 3), which the student does not mention. The student instead discusses transport destination, providing no relevant information about tirofiban or EVT premedication."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Endovascular thrombectomy is not recommended in this case due to the large ischemic core and limited hypoperfused tissue on CT perfusion imaging, as indicated by the clinical content extracted from the guidelines.",0.0,"WRONG: Current evidence supports performing EVT in selected patients with large ischemic core strokes, expanding prior eligibility criteria. The student's statement that EVT is not recommended due to a large core contradicts the reference guidance."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","The administration of IV aspirin concurrently or within 90 minutes after the start of IVT due to the risk of hemorrhage is not recommended, so it would be inappropriate to add an adjuvant antithrombotic agent such as IV aspirin in this patient.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student concludes that adding an adjuvant antithrombotic with IV thrombolysis is not recommended, aligning with evidence that adjunct antithrombotics do not improve outcomes and increase bleeding risk. Although they cite aspirin specifically and a narrower time window, the key management decision is correct."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","For a patient with acute ischemic stroke, the recommended blood glucose management is to treat persistent hyperglycemia to achieve blood glucose levels in a range of 140 to 180 mg/dL with close monitoring to prevent worse functional outcomes.",1.0,"CORRECT. The student correctly states that intensive glucose control is not recommended and that treating hyperglycemia to a target of 140–180 mg/dL is appropriate, which aligns with the guideline emphasis against tight control (80–130 mg/dL). Although BP management was not addressed, the reference answer only covered glycemic management."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to the guidelines, for a pediatric patient with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion within 24 hours from symptom onset, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) may be reasonable if performed by experienced neurointerventionalists.",1.0,"CORRECT. The student identifies that endovascular thrombectomy may be reasonable for select pediatric patients with large vessel occlusion, aligning with the guideline’s support for interventional treatment by experienced teams. The added 24-hour window does not contradict the reference’s general endorsement."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"The recommended emergency service for this patient is the Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU), as it provides direct emergency care, initiates treatment, and ensures accurate triage to the most appropriate hospitals, expediting care for patients with acute ischemic stroke, particularly those with large vessel occlusions.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly identifies the Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU) as the preferred service when available and notes its advantages in rapid treatment and triage, consistent with guideline-supported benefits over conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated in this patient as there is no evidence that it improves functional outcomes or reduces mortality in patients with acute ischemic stroke and brain swelling.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student concludes IV glibenclamide should not be initiated and cites lack of benefit in functional outcomes, aligning with the guideline’s Class 3 (No Benefit) recommendation for large hemispheric infarction. The added note about no mortality benefit does not contradict the reference."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","In patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who have failed or are unable to participate in a bedside swallow screening due to neurological disabilities, it is reasonable to perform an endoscopic examination of swallowing function to aid in determination of dysphagia severity and aspiration risk.",0.0,WRONG. The guideline-recommended management is pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk. The student answer discusses additional diagnostic evaluation (endoscopic exam) rather than the recommended treatment and does not address PES.
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?",The preoperative administration of tirofiban before EVT is not useful to improve 90-day functional outcome in patients with AIS and LVO.,1.0,"CORRECT: The student accurately states that preoperative tirofiban before EVT in AIS with LVO is not useful for improving 90-day functional outcomes, matching the guideline recommendation (Class III: No Benefit)."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","EVT with stent retrievers, contact aspiration, or combination techniques is recommended for rapid and adequate reperfusion in patients with AIS due to a large vessel occlusion (LVO), such as the patient described, presenting within 6 hours from symptom onset.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly recommends EVT for LVO, which applies here, but limits the treatment window to 6 hours instead of the guideline-supported 24-hour window for basilar artery occlusion and omits the basilar-specific criteria emphasized in the reference."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days may be considered to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in this patient, given her high-risk profile and lack of cardioembolic source.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student recognizes that short-term DAPT is indicated after a minor noncardioembolic stroke, but specifies ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days rather than the guideline-supported clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy."
