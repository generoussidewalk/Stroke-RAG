Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Current evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials, including the AcT trial and meta-analyses, suggests that intravenous tenecteplase (typically at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) is at least as effective as alteplase for acute ischemic stroke and offers practical advantages such as single-bolus administration rather than a one-hour infusion, and while both agents are considered acceptable options, tenecteplase has been increasingly adopted and is now recommended as an alternative to alteplase in updated guidelines (such as the 2024 AHA/ASA guidelines), with some data suggesting potential superiority in patients with large vessel occlusions, though for this patient with an NIHSS of 5 and no large vessel occlusion specified, both are reasonable choices with tenecteplase being favored for its ease of administration and comparable efficacy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that tenecteplase is at least as effective (noninferior) to alteplase and that current guidelines endorse either agent within the window, noting practical advantages of tenecteplase. This matches the reference, which endorses use of either agent based on noninferiority and potential advantages of tenecteplase."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis) should be administered promptly, as the patient is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, has no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, and has a disabling deficit (aphasia) that warrants treatment regardless of the relatively low NIHSS score, since current guidelines emphasize that potentially disabling symptoms should be treated with IV thrombolysis even when the overall NIHSS is low.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends prompt IV thrombolysis within the 4.5-hour window for a disabling deficit despite low NIHSS and absence of hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, aligning with guidelines. They do not require advanced imaging selection, consistent with the reference answer."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis), because the DWI-FLAIR mismatch — where there is restricted diffusion on DWI but no corresponding FLAIR signal change — suggests that the ischemic injury is likely less than 4.5 hours old despite the last known well being 10 hours ago, and according to the WAKE-UP trial, patients with wake-up stroke who demonstrate this DWI-FLAIR mismatch pattern are candidates for IV thrombolysis with alteplase as it was shown to result in significantly better functional outcomes compared to placebo.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies DWI–FLAIR mismatch in a wake-up/unknown-onset stroke as an imaging criterion supporting IV alteplase despite a long last-known-well time, consistent with extended-window thrombolysis per guidelines and the WAKE-UP trial."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Given that this patient presents within the treatment window with symptoms consistent with an acute ischemic stroke, the decision regarding intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) requires careful consideration; however, because her symptoms are classified as mild and non-disabling (NIHSS of 1 with isolated sensory deficit of the face and hand, no weakness, no speech difficulty, and no functional impairment), current AHA/ASA guidelines generally recommend against IV thrombolysis for mild, non-disabling strokes, and the recommended course of treatment is medical management with aspirin (or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel if due to minor stroke), risk factor optimization including blood pressure management, urgent vascular imaging (CT angiography) to evaluate for large vessel occlusion or significant stenosis, and admission for monitoring and stroke workup including cardiac evaluation, as the potential bleeding risks of thrombolytic therapy outweigh the expected benefits in this clinical scenario.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly recommends against IV thrombolysis for a mild, non-disabling stroke and mentions DAPT. However, they hedge with aspirin monotherapy instead of clearly recommending dual antiplatelet therapy as the preferred treatment per guidelines."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","This patient with a high NIHSS score of 14, suggesting a likely large vessel occlusion (LVO), who is within the early time window and can reach a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center within approximately 75 minutes total from symptom onset (20 minutes since onset plus 55 minutes transport), should be transported directly to the comprehensive stroke center (mothership approach) because current guidelines from the AHA/ASA recommend direct transport to a thrombectomy-capable center when the additional transport time is not excessive (generally considered reasonable if the comprehensive center can be reached within a total elapsed time that still allows for timely IV thrombolysis and endovascular therapy), and bypassing the closer primary stroke center avoids the delays inherent in interhospital transfer (drip-and-ship), given that his high NIHSS score raises strong suspicion for an LVO amenable to mechanical thrombectomy — though notably, if the additional transport time were to significantly delay IV tPA administration beyond the benefit window or if clinical deterioration occurred, diversion to the nearest primary stroke center would be appropriate.",0.0,"WRONG: The reference answer states that preoperative tirofiban before EVT is not beneficial (COR 3), but the student's response discusses transport strategy and does not address tirofiban, missing the key factual content."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, endovascular thrombectomy can still be performed because landmark trials such as HERMES meta-analysis and more recently the SELECT2, ANGEL-ASPECT, and RESCUE-Japan LIMIT trials have demonstrated benefit of mechanical thrombectomy even in patients with large ischemic cores (ASPECTS as low as 3–5 or core volumes up to 100 mL or more), provided there is a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and the patient presents within an appropriate time window, so despite the large core this patient with a proximal M1 MCA occlusion presenting at 4 hours should be considered a candidate for thrombectomy, though the treating team must weigh the increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation and the potentially more modest functional benefit against the natural history of such a devastating stroke.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly states that EVT can be performed despite a large ischemic core, citing recent trials supporting benefit in selected large-core LVO strokes. This matches the reference that evidence supports expanding EVT to some patients with larger ischemic cores."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","The most appropriate management decision is to avoid adding any adjuvant antithrombotic agent (such as antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) within the first 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, because current guidelines recommend delaying antithrombotic therapy for at least 24 hours following IV alteplase or tenecteplase administration due to the significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and clinical trials (such as those evaluating early antiplatelet use or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors as adjuncts to thrombolysis) have not demonstrated a net clinical benefit from concurrent antithrombotic therapy, so the standard of care is to obtain a follow-up CT at approximately 24 hours to rule for hemorrhagic transformation before initiating aspirin or other antithrombotic agents.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student advises against concurrent adjuvant antithrombotic therapy with IV thrombolysis, consistent with evidence showing no benefit. They also appropriately note waiting 24 hours and obtaining follow-up imaging before starting antithrombotics."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Based on current AHA/ASA guidelines for acute ischemic stroke management, blood glucose levels should be treated with insulin therapy to maintain concentrations in the range of 140–180 mg/dL (while strictly avoiding hypoglycemia below 60 mg/dL), as persistent hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL is associated with worse outcomes, and blood pressure should be permitted to remain at its current level (below 180/105 mmHg) without aggressive lowering for the first 24 hours after reperfusion therapy, since his systolic readings of 155–165 mmHg fall within the acceptable post-thrombolysis target of less than 180/105 mmHg, thereby preserving adequate cerebral perfusion to the ischemic penumbra.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly avoids intensive glucose control (80–130 mg/dL) and targets 140–180 mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia. They also accurately state that post-reperfusion blood pressure can be maintained below 180/105 mmHg, consistent with guidelines."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to current guidelines, this patient should receive intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) as he is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, and given the large vessel occlusion of the left MCA M1 segment with a significant neurological deficit (NIHSS 11), he should also be urgently evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy, as the 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines and subsequent pediatric stroke management recommendations support endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions in selected pediatric patients when performed at experienced centers, even though much of the evidence is extrapolated from adult trials.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly identifies that mechanical thrombectomy is supported for select pediatric AIS with large vessel occlusion at experienced centers. However, recommending IV alteplase in a 12-year-old is not supported by the referenced guidance and adds potentially inaccurate information not included in the reference answer."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"A mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred over conventional emergency services because it enables prehospital CT imaging, earlier diagnosis, and faster initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, thereby reducing door-to-needle times and improving clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly identifies the mobile stroke unit as the preferred option when available and accurately cites its advantages in earlier diagnosis and treatment, aligning with guideline-supported benefits over conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","Intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide) should not be initiated as standard clinical practice because, although the phase 2 GAMES-RP trial and the more recent phase 3 CHARM trial investigated IV glibenclamide for the prevention of malignant cerebral edema in large hemispheric infarctions—a scenario this patient is at high risk for given his NIHSS of 22 and early ischemic changes involving more than half the MCA territory—the CHARM trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit on the primary outcome of functional improvement, and IV glibenclamide is not yet FDA-approved or recommended by current guidelines for this indication, so while the patient should be evaluated urgently for IV thrombolysis (given the 3-hour window) and potentially thrombectomy, as well as close monitoring for malignant edema with neurosurgical consultation for possible decompressive hemicraniectomy, the use of IV glibenclamide remains investigational.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly states that IV glibenclamide should not be initiated and cites lack of functional benefit from trials, aligning with guidelines that do not recommend its use for large hemispheric infarction. Their additional context does not contradict the reference answer."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","According to current AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, this patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) until a formal dysphagia assessment is completed—which has already been done here via videofluoroscopic swallow study—and then managed with diet modification (such as thickened liquids and texture-modified foods to prevent aspiration of thin liquids), compensatory swallowing strategies, and referral to a speech-language pathologist for ongoing swallowing rehabilitation, with consideration of alternative enteral feeding (e.g., nasogastric tube) if adequate nutrition and hydration cannot be safely maintained orally, as early screening and systematic management of dysphagia are recommended to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration following acute ischemic stroke.",0.0,"WRONG: The reference specifically recommends pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) as beneficial (COR 2a). The student answer omits PES and instead lists general dysphagia management strategies, failing to include the key guideline-directed therapy."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, may be considered as a rescue therapy during endovascular thrombectomy if there is reocclusion, in-situ thrombosis, or refractory residual stenosis after mechanical thrombectomy, but it should not be administered routinely or prophylactically prior to or during the initial EVT attempt, because its use in the acute setting carries an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and current guidelines recommend that if tirofiban is used intra-arterially as a bailout strategy, it should be given at a low dose with careful monitoring, ideally after confirming the absence of significant infarct core hemorrhagic transformation on imaging, and its routine use remains investigational with evidence primarily derived from observational studies and small randomized trials (such as the RESCUE BT trial) suggesting potential benefit in select scenarios like early reocclusion or stent-assisted angioplasty rather than as a standard adjunct to first-line mechanical thrombectomy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states tirofiban should not be administered routinely or prophylactically before EVT, aligning with the guideline that preoperative tirofiban provides no benefit. Additional comments about bailout use do not contradict the reference answer."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","This patient presenting with posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke symptoms (vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, progressive weakness) at 6 hours from onset, with a high NIHSS of 18, a PC-ASPECTS of 7 (indicating moderate but not extensive early ischemic changes), and a pre-stroke mRS of 0, should undergo urgent CT angiography to confirm large vessel occlusion and, if a basilar artery or posterior circulation large vessel occlusion is identified, should be treated with endovascular thrombectomy (mechanical thrombectomy) — as supported by the ATTENTION and BAOCHE trials which demonstrated benefit of thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion up to 24 hours in selected patients — along with intravenous alteplase if still within the 4.5-hour window or if uncertainty exists about exact onset, while intravenous thrombolysis alone at 6 hours would generally be outside the standard window unless extended criteria apply, making endovascular therapy the primary reperfusion strategy in this clinical scenario.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies posterior circulation stroke with appropriate criteria (mRS 0, NIHSS ≥10, PC-ASPECTS ≥6) and recommends endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours, consistent with guidelines. Additional notes about confirming basilar occlusion with CTA and IV thrombolysis timing do not contradict the recommendation."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient presents with a minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS 3) with symptom onset 18 hours ago, a confirmed acute infarct on MRI, and significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis (70%) without a cardioembolic source, so she should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days (as supported by the CHANCE and POINT trials for minor stroke with NIHSS ≤3), followed by transition to single antiplatelet therapy (typically clopidogrel alone) for long-term secondary prevention, while also being urgently evaluated for carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting given the symptomatic high-grade (≥50%) internal carotid artery stenosis.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy in a minor noncardioembolic stroke with significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis and no IV thrombolysis, matching the reference guidance. The added note on carotid intervention evaluation does not contradict the guideline-based antiplatelet plan."
