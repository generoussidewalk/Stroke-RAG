Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Current evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials, including the AcT trial and meta-analyses, suggests that intravenous tenecteplase (typically at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg) is at least as effective as alteplase for acute ischemic stroke and offers practical advantages such as single-bolus administration rather than a one-hour infusion, and while both agents are considered acceptable options, tenecteplase has been increasingly adopted and is now recommended as an alternative to alteplase in updated guidelines (such as the 2024 AHA/ASA guidelines), with some data suggesting potential superiority in patients with large vessel occlusions, though for this patient with an NIHSS of 5 and no large vessel occlusion specified, both are reasonable choices with tenecteplase being favored for its ease of administration and comparable efficacy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that tenecteplase is at least as effective as alteplase and that both are acceptable options within the treatment window, aligning with the guideline-endorsed noninferiority. They appropriately note practical advantages of tenecteplase without claiming overall superior efficacy."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis) should be administered promptly, as the patient is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, has no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, and has a disabling deficit (aphasia) that warrants treatment regardless of the relatively low NIHSS score, since current guidelines recommend IV thrombolysis for patients with disabling symptoms even when the NIHSS is below typical treatment thresholds.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends prompt IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours for a disabling deficit despite low NIHSS and after a negative noncontrast CT, aligning with guidelines. This matches the reference, which endorses rapid treatment without requiring advanced imaging selection."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis), because this patient demonstrates a DWI-FLAIR mismatch — restricted diffusion on DWI without corresponding FLAIR signal change — which suggests that the ischemic injury is likely within 4.5 hours of onset despite the last known well being 10 hours ago, and according to the WAKE-UP trial, patients with wake-up stroke who have a DWI-FLAIR mismatch benefit from IV thrombolysis even when the exact time of onset is unknown.",1.0,"CORRECT: DWI-FLAIR mismatch in a wake-up/unknown-onset stroke supports IV thrombolysis based on imaging selection criteria per guidelines (e.g., WAKE-UP). Administering IV alteplase is the appropriate next step despite last known well being 10 hours ago."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Given that this patient presents within the treatment window (2 hours from onset) with symptoms consistent with acute ischemic stroke, but has only isolated sensory deficits (decreased pinprick sensation over the face and hand) with an NIHSS of 1 and no evidence of hemorrhage on CT, the recommended course of treatment is **not to administer IV alteplase (tPA)**, as current AHA/ASA guidelines generally recommend against IV thrombolysis for patients with mild, non-disabling stroke symptoms (NIHSS ≤ 5 without clearly disabling deficits), and instead the patient should be managed with aspirin therapy, admission for stroke workup (including vascular imaging, echocardiography, and cardiac monitoring to identify the stroke mechanism), and initiation of appropriate secondary prevention measures including optimization of blood pressure control.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly recommends against IV thrombolysis for a mild, non-disabling stroke, but they recommend aspirin monotherapy rather than the guideline-preferred dual antiplatelet therapy for this presentation."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","This patient with a high NIHSS score of 14, suggesting a likely large vessel occlusion (LVO), who is within the early time window and can reach a thrombectomy-capable comprehensive stroke center (CSC) within approximately 75 minutes total from symptom onset (20 minutes since onset plus 55 minutes transport), should be transported directly to the comprehensive stroke center, because current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend direct routing to a thrombectomy-capable center when the additional transport time does not exceed a reasonable threshold (generally no more than 15–30 minutes additional travel compared to the nearest primary stroke center) and the patient has a high clinical suspicion for LVO, as bypassing the primary stroke center avoids the delays inherent in inter-facility transfer (door-in-door-out time) and the total time from onset to potential thrombectomy and intravenous thrombolysis (which can also be administered at the CSC) remains well within the treatment window.",0.0,"WRONG: The student discusses transport routing to a comprehensive stroke center, but the reference addresses that preoperative tirofiban before EVT is not beneficial. The student does not mention tirofiban and does not include the key factual information from the reference."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, endovascular thrombectomy can still be performed because recent landmark trials such as RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, SELECT2, and ANGEL-ASPECT have demonstrated that mechanical thrombectomy provides significant clinical benefit even in patients with large ischemic cores (typically defined as ASPECTS 3–5 or core volumes up to 100 mL or more), provided there is a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and the patient presents within an appropriate time window, so a large core alone is no longer an absolute contraindication to thrombectomy, though careful patient selection considering factors such as age, baseline functional status, and the extent of established infarction is essential to optimize outcomes.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student accurately states that EVT can be performed in patients with large ischemic cores based on recent trials and that large core is not an absolute contraindication, aligning with the reference that evidence supports EVT benefit in this group."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","The most appropriate management decision is to avoid adding any adjuvant antithrombotic agent (such as antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) within the first 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, because current guidelines recommend delaying antithrombotic therapy for at least 24 hours following IV alteplase or tenecteplase administration due to the significantly increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and clinical trials have consistently shown that combining antithrombotic agents with IV thrombolysis does not improve outcomes but rather worsens safety profiles.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly recommends not adding adjuvant antithrombotic therapy with IV thrombolysis, aligning with evidence showing no benefit. The added point about delaying antithrombotics for 24 hours is guideline-consistent and does not conflict with the reference answer."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Based on current AHA/ASA guidelines for acute ischemic stroke management, this patient's hyperglycemia should be treated with insulin therapy to maintain blood glucose levels in the range of 140–180 mg/dL (since persistent hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL is associated with worse neurological outcomes and larger infarct volumes) while avoiding hypoglycemia below 60 mg/dL, and his blood pressure of 155–165 mm Hg should be permitted (not aggressively lowered) in the first 24 hours post-reperfusion therapy as long as it remains below 180/105 mm Hg, since moderate permissive hypertension helps maintain cerebral perfusion to the ischemic penumbra, with cautious antihypertensive initiation or resumption considered after neurological stabilization, typically within 24–48 hours, aiming for a gradual reduction of no more than 15% in the first 24 hours if treatment is deemed necessary.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends moderate glucose control (140–180 mg/dL) rather than intensive 80–130 mg/dL and emphasizes avoiding hypoglycemia, aligning with the guideline’s stance. Their permissive BP approach (<180/105 mm Hg post-reperfusion) is also consistent with current recommendations."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to current guidelines, this patient should receive intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) as he is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, and given the large vessel occlusion of the left MCA M1 segment with a significant neurological deficit (NIHSS 11), he should also be urgently evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy, as the 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines and subsequent pediatric stroke management recommendations support endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions in selected pediatric patients, particularly when presenting within 24 hours with a significant deficit and salvageable brain tissue, even though much of the evidence is extrapolated from adult trials such as MR CLEAN, ESCAPE, and EXTEND-IA.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly recommends evaluation for mechanical thrombectomy in a pediatric large-vessel occlusion, aligning with current guidance emphasizing endovascular therapy in selected children. However, stating that a 12-year-old “should receive” IV alteplase is not supported by pediatric guidelines, which generally do not recommend routine IV tPA in children outside research settings."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"A mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred over conventional emergency services because it enables prehospital CT imaging, earlier diagnosis, and faster initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, thereby reducing time to treatment and improving functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly identifies the MSU as preferred and provides accurate reasons (prehospital imaging, earlier diagnosis, faster thrombolysis, improved outcomes) that align with guideline-supported benefits over conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","Intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide) should not be initiated as standard clinical practice because, although the phase 2 GAMES-RP trial and the more recent phase 3 CHARM trial investigated IV glibenclamide for its potential to reduce malignant cerebral edema in large hemispheric infarctions by inhibiting SUR1-TRPM4 channels, the CHARM trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint, and IV glibenclamide is not currently FDA-approved or recommended by guidelines for this indication, meaning this patient—who is at high risk for malignant edema given his large MCA territory infarct and high NIHSS—should instead be managed with standard measures including consideration of IV thrombolysis (given the 3-hour window), possible thrombectomy evaluation, close neurological monitoring in an ICU setting, osmotic therapy as needed, and early neurosurgical consultation for potential decompressive hemicraniectomy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student explicitly states that IV glibenclamide should not be initiated and cites trial/guideline lack of benefit in large hemispheric infarction, matching the reference recommendation."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","According to current AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, this patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) until a formal dysphagia assessment is completed—which has already been done here via videofluoroscopic swallow study—and then managed with diet modification (such as thickened liquids and texture-modified foods to prevent aspiration of thin liquids), compensatory swallowing strategies, and referral to a speech-language pathologist for ongoing swallowing rehabilitation, with consideration of alternative enteral feeding (e.g., nasogastric tube) if adequate nutrition and hydration cannot be safely maintained orally, as early screening and systematic management of dysphagia are recommended to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration following acute ischemic stroke.",0.0,WRONG. The student describes general dysphagia management but omits the key guideline recommendation: pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) (COR 2a) to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk.
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, may be considered as a rescue therapy during endovascular thrombectomy if there is reocclusion, in-situ thrombosis, or residual thrombus after mechanical thrombectomy attempts, but it should not be administered routinely or prophylactically prior to or during the standard EVT procedure because its use in the acute setting carries an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and current guidelines recommend that if tirofiban is used intra-arterially as a bailout strategy, it should be given at a low dose with careful monitoring, ideally after confirming no hemorrhagic transformation on imaging, while weighing the potential benefit of achieving vessel recanalization against the bleeding risk—particularly in this patient who is likely on anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation, which further elevates hemorrhagic risk.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly states that tirofiban should not be administered routinely or prophylactically before EVT, aligning with the guideline that preoperative tirofiban provides no benefit. Additional comments about possible rescue use do not contradict the reference answer."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","This patient presenting with posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke symptoms (vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, progressive weakness) at 6 hours from onset, with a high NIHSS of 18, a PC-ASPECTS of 7 (indicating moderate but not extensive early ischemic changes), and a pre-stroke mRS of 0, should undergo urgent CT angiography to confirm large vessel occlusion and, if a basilar artery or posterior circulation large vessel occlusion is identified, should be treated with endovascular thrombectomy (mechanical thrombectomy) — as supported by the ATTENTION and BAOCHE trials which demonstrated benefit of thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion up to 24 hours in selected patients — along with intravenous alteplase if still within the 4.5-hour window or if uncertainty exists about exact onset, while intravenous thrombolysis alone at 6 hours would generally be outside the standard window unless guided by advanced imaging.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours for suspected basilar artery occlusion with NIHSS ≥10 and PC-ASPECTS ≥6, consistent with guidelines. The added note about confirming LVO with CTA and IV thrombolysis being outside the 4.5-hour window at 6 hours does not contradict the recommendation."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient presents with a minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS 3) with symptom onset 18 hours ago and a confirmed acute infarct on MRI, and based on the CHANCE and POINT trials, she should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days (initiated within 24 hours of symptom onset), followed by transition to single antiplatelet therapy (typically clopidogrel alone), as DAPT has been shown to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in minor stroke and high-risk TIA patients compared to aspirin monotherapy, and this is particularly important given her significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis (70%) which should also prompt evaluation for carotid endarterectomy or stenting.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 days initiated within 24 hours, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, which matches the guideline for minor noncardioembolic stroke with significant atherosclerotic stenosis. The added note on carotid intervention evaluation does not conflict with the reference answer."
