Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Neither—within 4.5 hours, tenecteplase 0.25 mg/kg and alteplase 0.9 mg/kg yield comparable functional outcomes and safety (tenecteplase shown noninferior in multiple phase 3 RCTs), so either is recommended, with tenecteplase often favored for its single-bolus administration.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase within the 4.5-hour window and that either can be used, aligning with guidelines. They also appropriately note practical advantages of tenecteplase without claiming superiority."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis with alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg) immediately because he presents 90 minutes from onset with a clearly disabling aphasia despite a low NIHSS and a negative head CT, for which guidelines recommend treatment.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends immediate IV thrombolysis within the 4.5-hour window for a disabling deficit despite low NIHSS and negative CT, aligning with guidelines and not requiring advanced imaging selection."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administer IV thrombolysis (e.g., alteplase or tenecteplase) now because the DWI–FLAIR mismatch in this wake-up stroke indicates treatable tissue despite a 10-hour last-known-well and the patient has disabling deficits with no intracranial hemorrhage.",1.0,CORRECT: The presence of a DWI–FLAIR mismatch in a wake-up stroke supports IV thrombolysis despite an unknown/extended time from last-known-well. This aligns with guideline-supported extended-window thrombolysis using advanced imaging selection.
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Withhold IV thrombolysis because her symptoms are minor and not clearly disabling (isolated hemisensory loss, NIHSS 1), and initiate early dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy to reduce 90-day recurrent stroke risk.",1.0,CORRECT: The student appropriately recommends withholding IV thrombolysis for a non-disabling isolated sensory deficit and initiating dual antiplatelet therapy. The added details on aspirin plus clopidogrel and short-course duration align with guideline-based practice and do not contradict the reference.
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Transport him to the nearest primary stroke center with EMS prenotification for immediate imaging and IV thrombolysis, then expedite transfer for thrombectomy if LVO is confirmed, because randomized data and 2026 guidelines show no outcome benefit—and reduced IVT use—when bypassing a capable local center for a thrombectomy-capable center 45–60 minutes farther away.",0.0,"WRONG: The student's answer addresses transport destination for suspected LVO, whereas the reference answer concerns the lack of benefit of preoperative tirofiban before EVT. It omits the key point about tirofiban and does not match the reference."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes—EVT can be performed because in the 0–6-hour window patients <80 years with proximal ICA/M1 LVO and NIHSS ≥6 are eligible, with EVT recommended for ASPECTS 3–10 and reasonable even for ASPECTS 0–2 if there is no significant mass effect and prestroke mRS 0–1, despite a large core.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly states that EVT can be performed despite a large ischemic core, consistent with expanding indications. However, they add inaccurate specifics (e.g., age <80 restriction and suggesting EVT is reasonable for ASPECTS 0–2), which are not supported by current evidence/guidelines."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Do not add any adjuvant antithrombotic during or soon after IV thrombolysis; instead withhold antiplatelets for 24 hours and initiate aspirin only after a 24-hour CT excludes hemorrhage, because adjunctive agents (eptifibatide, abciximab, tirofiban, or early IV aspirin) have no proven benefit and increase bleeding risk per AIS guidelines.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly recommends against adding adjuvant antithrombotic therapy with IV thrombolysis, consistent with evidence showing no benefit. The additional note about delaying antiplatelets for 24 hours after a hemorrhage-excluding CT is guideline-concordant and does not contradict the reference."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Use standard glycemic control with subcutaneous insulin to target 140–180 mg/dL and avoid hypoglycemia (intensive IV insulin to 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended), and manage blood pressure permissively with a goal SBP <180/105 mm Hg for at least 24 hours after IV thrombolysis—avoiding intensive reduction to <140 mm Hg, particularly after successful EVT—so his current SBP of 155–165 mm Hg is acceptable without aggressive lowering.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly notes that intensive glucose control to 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended and suggests standard targets (140–180 mg/dL) with avoidance of hypoglycemia, aligning with guidelines. The added blood pressure guidance is consistent and does not contradict the reference."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","Because he is ≥6 years old with a disabling anterior-circulation large-vessel occlusion within 6 hours and no hemorrhage, current guidelines recommend immediate endovascular thrombectomy by an experienced neurointerventionalist and, given presentation within 4.5 hours, consideration of IV alteplase as bridging therapy after pediatric stroke consultation, as EVT improves outcomes in children whereas IVT appears safe though its efficacy is uncertain.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies that current guidelines support endovascular thrombectomy for select pediatric AIS with LVO and no hemorrhage, consistent with the reference’s endorsement of interventional therapy and its safety/potential benefit. The mention of IV alteplase is additional detail and does not contradict the reference."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Deploy the Mobile Stroke Unit, because randomized trials and meta-analyses show MSUs provide on-scene imaging and specialist care that shorten onset-to-needle time, increase golden-hour thrombolysis, improve 90-day functional outcomes, and safely expedite LVO triage compared with conventional EMS.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly prefers the Mobile Stroke Unit and notes its benefits in faster treatment and improved outcomes, consistent with guideline-supported evidence favoring MSUs over conventional EMS when available."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, IV glibenclamide should not be initiated because in large hemispheric infarction it has not improved 90-day functional outcomes in RCTs and is not recommended by current guidelines.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that IV glibenclamide is not recommended for large hemispheric infarction due to lack of functional benefit, aligning with the guideline’s Class III (No Benefit) recommendation for this 54-year-old patient."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","Per current AIS guidelines, manage her confirmed dysphagia by keeping her NPO for unsafe consistencies and initiating SLP-directed therapy with texture/viscosity modification (e.g., thickened liquids), aspiration precautions and an oral hygiene protocol, providing early enteral nutrition via a nasogastric tube within 7 days (and considering PEG if safe swallowing is unlikely to recover within >2–3 weeks), and considering pharyngeal electrical stimulation to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration, with close reassessment to minimize pneumonia risk and maintain adequate nutrition.",1.0,CORRECT: The student includes the key guideline-supported intervention—pharyngeal electrical stimulation to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration (COR 2a). Additional management details do not contradict the reference and are reasonable but not required for credit.
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Do not administer preprocedural tirofiban, as it should not delay EVT and current evidence (e.g., RESCUE-BT) shows no improvement in 90-day functional outcomes with possible increased intracranial hemorrhage risk.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student states that preprocedural tirofiban should not be given before EVT because it does not improve 90-day functional outcomes, aligning with the COR 3: No Benefit recommendation. Mention of not delaying EVT and potential increased ICH risk does not contradict the guideline."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","He should undergo urgent vascular imaging and, if basilar artery occlusion is confirmed, proceed immediately to endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours because with baseline mRS 0, NIHSS 18, and PC-ASPECTS 7 EVT is recommended to improve outcomes and reduce mortality, while IV thrombolysis is outside the 4.5-hour window.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly recommends endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours for suspected basilar artery occlusion given mRS 0, NIHSS 18, and PC-ASPECTS 7, aligning with the guideline criteria. The addition of confirming occlusion with vascular imaging is appropriate, and noting IV thrombolysis is outside the typical 4.5-hour window does not contradict the reference."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","Because she has a minor noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (NIHSS 3) presenting within 24 hours without IV thrombolysis, initiate dual antiplatelet therapy now with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy long-term, with ticagrelor plus aspirin as a reasonable alternative if a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele is present.",1.0,"CORRECT. The student recommends initiating aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy, which matches the guideline for minor noncardioembolic stroke with large-artery atherosclerosis and no IVT. The mention of ticagrelor as an alternative in CYP2C19 loss-of-function patients does not contradict the reference."
