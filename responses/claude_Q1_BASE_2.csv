Q,A
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","Current evidence from recent randomized controlled trials, including the AcT trial and meta-analyses, suggests that intravenous tenecteplase (administered as a single bolus at 0.25 mg/kg) is at least as effective as alteplase for acute ischemic stroke and offers practical advantages such as easier single-bolus administration, but it has not been definitively proven to be *more* effective than alteplase in terms of functional outcomes, so while tenecteplase is increasingly favored due to its non-inferior efficacy and simpler dosing—and the 2024 AHA/ASA guidelines now include it as a reasonable alternative—both agents remain acceptable thrombolytic options for this patient who presents within the treatment window with a moderate stroke severity."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis) should be administered promptly, as the patient is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, has no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, and has a disabling deficit (aphasia) that warrants treatment regardless of the relatively low NIHSS score, since current guidelines emphasize that potentially disabling symptoms should not be excluded from thrombolytic therapy based solely on a low numerical score."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous alteplase (IV thrombolysis), because the DWI-FLAIR mismatch — where there is restricted diffusion on DWI but no corresponding FLAIR signal change — suggests that the ischemic injury is likely less than 4.5 hours old despite the last known well being 10 hours ago, and according to the WAKE-UP trial, patients with wake-up stroke who demonstrate this DWI-FLAIR mismatch pattern are candidates for IV thrombolysis with alteplase as it was shown to result in significantly better functional outcomes compared to placebo."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Given that this patient presents within the treatment window with symptoms consistent with an acute ischemic stroke, the decision regarding intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) requires careful consideration; however, because her symptoms are classified as mild and non-disabling (NIHSS of 1 with isolated sensory deficit of the face and hand, no weakness, no speech difficulty, and no functional impairment), current AHA/ASA guidelines generally recommend against IV thrombolysis for mild, non-disabling strokes, and the recommended course of treatment is medical management with aspirin (or dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel if due to minor ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA), risk factor optimization including blood pressure management, urgent vascular imaging (CT angiography of the head and neck) to evaluate for large vessel occlusion or significant stenosis, and admission for monitoring and further stroke workup including cardiac evaluation, as the potential bleeding risks of thrombolytic therapy outweigh the benefits in this clinical scenario."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","This patient with a high NIHSS score of 14, suggesting a likely large vessel occlusion (LVO), who is within the early time window and can reach a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center within approximately 75 minutes total from symptom onset (20 minutes since onset plus 55 minutes transport), should be transported directly to the comprehensive stroke center (mothership approach) because current guidelines from the AHA/ASA recommend direct transport to a thrombectomy-capable center when the additional transport time is not excessive (generally considered reasonable if the comprehensive center can be reached within a total elapsed time that still allows for timely IV thrombolysis and endovascular therapy), and bypassing the closer primary stroke center avoids the delays inherent in interhospital transfer (drip-and-ship), given that his high NIHSS score raises strong suspicion for an LVO amenable to mechanical thrombectomy — though notably, if the additional transport time were to significantly delay IV tPA administration beyond the benefit window or if clinical deterioration occurred, diversion to the nearest primary stroke center would be appropriate."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, endovascular thrombectomy can still be performed because recent landmark trials such as RESCUE-Japan LIMIT, SELECT2, and ANGEL-ASPECT have demonstrated that mechanical thrombectomy provides significant clinical benefit even in patients with large ischemic cores (typically defined as ASPECTS 3–5 or core volumes up to 100 mL or more), provided there is a large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation and the patient presents within an appropriate time window, so a large core alone is no longer an absolute contraindication to thrombectomy, though careful patient selection considering factors such as age, baseline functional status, and the extent of established infarction is essential to optimize outcomes."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","The most appropriate management decision is to avoid adding any adjuvant antithrombotic agent (such as antiplatelet or antithrombotic therapy) within the first 24 hours after intravenous thrombolysis, because clinical trials (including studies evaluating agents like eptifibatide, argatroban, and early antiplatelet use) have consistently shown that adjuvant antithrombotic therapy administered concurrently with or shortly after IV alteplase does not improve clinical outcomes and significantly increases the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and current AHA/ASA guidelines recommend delaying antithrombotic therapy for at least 24 hours following IV thrombolysis until a follow-up brain imaging study confirms the absence of hemorrhagic transformation."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Based on current AHA/ASA guidelines for acute ischemic stroke management, blood glucose levels should be treated with insulin therapy to maintain levels in the range of 140–180 mg/dL (since hyperglycemia above 180 mg/dL is associated with worse outcomes and hypoglycemia must be avoided), while blood pressure should be permitted to remain at its current levels (below 180/105 mmHg) following reperfusion therapy, as aggressive lowering below 180/105 mmHg in the first 24 hours post-thrombolysis is recommended but his readings of 155–165 mmHg systolic are already within the acceptable range and do not require urgent pharmacologic reduction unless there is evidence of end-organ damage."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to current guidelines, this patient should receive intravenous alteplase (IV tPA) as he is within the 4.5-hour treatment window, and given the large vessel occlusion of the left MCA M1 segment with a significant neurological deficit (NIHSS 11), he should also be urgently evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy, as the 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines and subsequent pediatric stroke management recommendations support endovascular thrombectomy for large vessel occlusions in selected pediatric patients when performed at experienced centers, even though much of the evidence is extrapolated from adult trials."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"A mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred over conventional emergency services because it enables prehospital CT imaging, earlier diagnosis, and faster initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, thereby significantly reducing the time from symptom onset to treatment and improving clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","Intravenous glibenclamide (glyburide) should not be initiated as standard clinical practice because, although the phase 2 GAMES-RP trial and the more recent phase 3 CHARM trial investigated IV glibenclamide for the prevention of malignant cerebral edema in large hemispheric infarctions — a scenario this patient is at high risk for given his NIHSS of 22 and early ischemic changes involving more than half the MCA territory — the CHARM trial did not demonstrate a significant benefit on the primary outcome of functional improvement, and IV glibenclamide is not yet FDA-approved or recommended by current guidelines for this indication, so management should instead focus on established therapies including IV alteplase (given he is within the treatment window and if no contraindications exist), consideration of mechanical thrombectomy, and close monitoring with neurosurgical consultation for possible decompressive hemicraniectomy if malignant edema develops."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","According to current AHA/ASA stroke guidelines, this patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) for thin liquids and started on a modified diet with thickened liquids and texture-modified foods as guided by the videofluoroscopic swallow study findings, with ongoing speech-language pathology involvement for swallowing rehabilitation, compensatory strategies (such as chin-tuck positioning), and serial reassessments, because early identification and management of dysphagia—including dietary modifications tailored to the severity of aspiration risk—has been shown to reduce the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and dehydration in acute stroke patients, and if adequate nutrition and hydration cannot be safely maintained orally, enteral feeding (such as nasogastric tube placement) should be considered."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, may be considered as a rescue therapy during endovascular thrombectomy if there is reocclusion, in-situ thrombosis, or residual thrombus after mechanical thrombectomy attempts, but it should not be administered routinely or prophylactically prior to or during the standard EVT procedure, because its use in the acute setting carries an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and current guidelines recommend that if tirofiban is used intra-arterially as a bailout strategy, it should be given at a low dose with careful monitoring, ideally after confirming the absence of significant infarct core hemorrhagic transformation on imaging, and its routine use remains investigational without strong Class I evidence supporting it in the periprocedural EVT setting."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","This patient presenting with posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke symptoms (vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, progressive weakness) at 6 hours from onset, with a high NIHSS of 18, a PC-ASPECTS of 7 (indicating moderate but not extensive early ischemic changes), and a pre-stroke mRS of 0, should undergo urgent CT angiography to confirm large vessel occlusion and, if a basilar artery or posterior circulation large vessel occlusion is identified, should be treated with endovascular thrombectomy (mechanical thrombectomy) — as supported by the ATTENTION and BAOCHE trials which demonstrated benefit of thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion up to 24 hours in selected patients — along with intravenous alteplase if still within the 4.5-hour window or if uncertainty exists about exact onset, while intravenous thrombolysis alone at 6 hours would generally be outside the standard window unless guided by advanced imaging."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient presents with a minor ischemic stroke (NIHSS 3) with symptom onset 18 hours ago, a confirmed acute infarct on MRI, and significant ipsilateral carotid stenosis (70%) without a cardioembolic source, so she should be started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel for 21 days (as supported by the CHANCE and POINT trials for minor stroke with NIHSS ≤3), followed by transition to single antiplatelet therapy (typically clopidogrel or aspirin alone) for long-term secondary prevention, while also being urgently evaluated for carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting given the symptomatic high-grade (≥50%) internal carotid artery stenosis."
