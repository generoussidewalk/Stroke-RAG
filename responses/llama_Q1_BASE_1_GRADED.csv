Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?",Intravenous tenecteplase is generally considered more effective than alteplase in acute ischemic stroke due to its higher efficacy and lower risk of bleeding complications.,0.0,"WRONG: Guidelines endorse either alteplase or tenecteplase within 4.5 hours, with evidence of noninferiority rather than superiority. The student’s claim that tenecteplase is more effective with lower bleeding risk contradicts the reference."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","Administering intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within the next 60 minutes is the most appropriate next step given the patient's presentation and imaging findings, as it may improve his chances of regaining functional independence.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends prompt IV tPA for a disabling ischemic stroke within the treatment window, matching guideline recommendations. Although they do not explicitly note that advanced imaging is not required, their proposed action aligns with the reference answer."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?",Administering IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset is indicated given the patient's presentation and MRI findings consistent with acute ischemic stroke in a large vessel territory.,0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The recommendation to administer IV alteplase aligns with using imaging-based criteria in wake-up/unknown-onset stroke. However, the student incorrectly frames it as within the standard 4.5-hour window rather than the extended window based on DWI-FLAIR mismatch."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","The recommended course of treatment for this patient, given her presentation consistent with isolated facial numbness without other neurological deficits, would be to administer IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, as she meets the criteria for acute ischemic stroke treatment despite having a low NIH Stroke Scale score.",0.0,"WRONG: For non-disabling isolated sensory deficits within 4.5 hours, thrombolysis is not recommended; dual antiplatelet therapy is preferred. The student incorrectly recommends IV tPA."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","The patient should be transported directly to the comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center, as the potential benefits of mechanical thrombectomy outweigh the increased transportation time and distance.",0.0,"WRONG: The student’s answer addresses transport destination, while the reference answer concerns the lack of benefit of pre-EVT tirofiban. It does not contain the key factual information from the reference answer."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Endovascular thrombectomy is generally not recommended in cases where the CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core, as it may not significantly improve outcomes due to the extensive brain damage already present.",0.0,"WRONG: Current evidence supports endovascular thrombectomy in selected patients with large ischemic cores, showing benefit in some cases. The student's statement that it is generally not recommended contradicts updated guidelines and trial data."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","The addition of an adjuvant antithrombotic agent, such as aspirin or clopidogrel, to intravenous thrombolysis in this patient with acute ischemic stroke and no large vessel occlusion is not recommended due to increased risk of bleeding complications.",1.0,"CORRECT. The student concludes that adjuvant antithrombotic therapy with IV thrombolysis is not recommended, aligning with the reference. Although they cite aspirin/clopidogrel and bleeding risk rather than argatroban/eptifibatide and lack of benefit, the management decision matches guidelines."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","According to current stroke guidelines, the patient's blood glucose should be maintained between 140-180 mg/dL to prevent both hyperglycemia-induced cerebral edema and hypoglycemic complications, while his blood pressure should be lowered to a target systolic blood pressure of less than 140 mm Hg.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly identifies the recommended glucose target range of 140–180 mg/dL, aligning with guidelines that advise against intensive control (80–130 mg/dL) due to hypoglycemia risk. The blood pressure recommendation is not addressed in the reference answer and does not affect grading here."
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","This patient's acute ischemic stroke should be managed with immediate administration of IV alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, as per the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines for pediatric stroke management.",0.0,"WRONG: The reference emphasizes endovascular intervention for select pediatric AIS (e.g., large-vessel occlusion) and does not recommend routine IV alteplase use in children. The student incorrectly recommends IV alteplase and omits endovascular therapy, contradicting the guideline focus."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"The mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred in this scenario because it has on-board CT scanning capabilities, allowing for rapid diagnosis of acute ischemic stroke and administration of thrombolytic therapy within the first 60 minutes of symptom onset, which can significantly improve outcomes.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly identifies the mobile stroke unit as preferred and explains its advantage of rapid imaging and thrombolysis, consistent with guideline-supported benefits over conventional EMS."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","Intravenous glibenclamide is not indicated in this case as it is typically used for treating malignant hypertension and symptomatic vasospasm, but not acute ischemic stroke management.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT. The conclusion that IV glibenclamide should not be initiated aligns with guidelines (no benefit). However, the rationale is inaccurate; glibenclamide is not used for malignant hypertension or vasospasm."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","The patient's dysphagia should be managed with a comprehensive swallowing evaluation and implementation of appropriate dietary modifications and compensatory strategies, including the use of thickened liquids or alternative forms of nutrition such as enteral feeding, according to current stroke guidelines.",0.0,"WRONG: The guideline-recommended intervention is pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk. The student answer omits PES and instead lists general dysphagia management strategies, failing to include the key recommendation."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Tirofiban, a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, can be considered as part of the initial treatment regimen to prevent distal embolization during EVT, but its use should be carefully weighed against the potential risk of bleeding and monitored closely.",0.0,"WRONG: The student recommends considering tirofiban pre-EVT, which contradicts the guideline stating there is no benefit to preoperative tirofiban in AIS with LVO undergoing EVT. It should not be used to improve outcomes."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","This patient should be immediately evaluated for acute ischemic stroke with a non-contrast head CT scan to rule out hemorrhagic transformation or other causes of stroke, followed by administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) if the diagnosis is confirmed and the time window allows.",0.0,"WRONG: The key recommended therapy here is endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours for basilar artery occlusion with NIHSS ≥10 and PC-ASPECTS ≥6. The student omits EVT and instead recommends IV tPA, which is not appropriate at 6 hours and misses the guideline-directed management."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient's antiplatelet therapy should be initiated with aspirin 325 mg daily, given her high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke due to the presence of significant carotid stenosis and a recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) equivalent.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT. Antiplatelet therapy is indicated, but in this scenario guidelines recommend short-course dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel) for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy. The student’s answer proposes aspirin monotherapy and omits clopidogrel and the 21-day DAPT strategy."
