Q,A,score,explanation
"A 48 year-old female with a history of type 2 diabetes  and hyperlipidemia is brought to the emergency department after left sided weakness and expressive aphasia that begins 2 hours prior to arrival. Her stroke scale is 5. Non-contrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the more effective form of thrombolytic treatment, intravenous tenecteplase or alteplase?","According to the 2026 AHA/ASA guideline, in adult patients with acute ischemic stroke presenting within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, tenecteplase at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg (max 25 mg) and alteplase at a dose of 0.9 mg/kg are both recommended to improve functional outcomes, as multiple large phase 3 randomized controlled trials have demonstrated noninferiority of tenecteplase compared to alteplase with similar safety profiles, meaning neither agent has been proven more effective than the other and both are considered appropriate first-line intravenous thrombolytic options for this patient.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student correctly states that tenecteplase is noninferior to alteplase and that either agent is appropriate within the 4.5-hour window, implying neither is more effective. This aligns with the reference guidance."
"A 64 year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 90 minutes after sudden onset of left facial droop and slurred speech. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 4, driven primarily by aphasia, which is felt to be a disabling deficit. Noncontrast head ct shows no intracranial hemorrhage. What is the most appropriate next step?","The most appropriate next step is to administer intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) as quickly as possible, because the guidelines recommend that in adult patients with acute ischemic stroke and disabling deficits—regardless of NIHSS score—who are eligible for IVT within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, treatment should be initiated without delay, and this patient's severe aphasia (≥2 on the NIHSS ""best language"" question) qualifies as a clearly disabling deficit per Table 4, he is within the 4.5-hour treatment window at 90 minutes, and noncontrast head CT has already excluded intracranial hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student recommends immediate IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours for a disabling deficit after excluding hemorrhage on noncontrast CT, aligning with guidelines that do not require advanced imaging selection."
"A 70 year old male is brought to the ED with a history of atrial fibrillation and is found to have left-sided weakness and neglect upon awakening. His last known well was approximately 10 hours earlier and his NIH stroke scale score is 4. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. MRI of the brain shows restricted diffusions through the right middle cerebral artery on diffusion weighted imaging. However, there is no corresponding signal change on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. What is the most appropriate next step?","Based on the clinical scenario, this patient has a wake-up stroke with last known well approximately 10 hours ago, an NIHSS score of 4, and crucially demonstrates a DWI-FLAIR mismatch on MRI (restricted diffusion on DWI without corresponding FLAIR signal change), which suggests the ischemic injury is likely within the 4.5-hour window despite the unknown exact onset time. According to Recommendation 7, in patients with suspected AIS who awaken with symptoms or have an unknown time of onset 4.5 to 24 hours from last known well, CTP or MR DWI-PWI selection with automated postprocessing software analysis can be useful to determine eligibility for extended window IV thrombolysis (IVT), and additionally Recommendation 9 states that MRI DWI-FLAIR mismatch can be useful in evaluation for EVT if a large vessel occlusion is present; therefore, the most appropriate next step is to use the DWI-FLAIR mismatch finding to support eligibility for extended-window IV thrombolysis, while also performing vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) to evaluate for a large vessel occlusion that might warrant endovascular thrombectomy consideration, since the DWI-FLAIR mismatch indicates the infarct is early enough that reperfusion therapy may still be beneficial.",0.5,"PARTIALLY CORRECT: The student correctly identifies that a DWI-FLAIR mismatch supports eligibility for extended-window IV thrombolysis in a wake-up/unknown-onset stroke. However, they inaccurately cite a 4.5–24 hour window for IV thrombolysis and incorrectly suggest DWI-FLAIR mismatch as an EVT selection tool; extended IVT is generally supported up to 9 hours (or unknown onset) with appropriate imaging, and EVT selection relies on vascular occlusion and perfusion-based criteria."
"A 59 year old woman with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 2 hours of sudden onset of numbness involving her right face. She denies weakness, speech difficulty, visual changes, or gait disturbances. Sensory testing reveals isolated decreased pinprick sensation over her face and hand. Her NIH Stroke Scale was a 1. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. WHat is the recommended course of treatment for this patient?","Based on the guidelines, this patient presents with a minor noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score of 1) with isolated hemisensory loss—a deficit that ""may not be clearly disabling in an individual patient"" per Table 4—and since she is within 24 hours of symptom onset, did not receive IVT, and her deficits are not clearly disabling (making her a less compelling candidate for IV thrombolysis), the recommended course of treatment is to initiate dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel early, continue it for 21 days, and then transition to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) to reduce the 90-day risk of recurrent stroke, as supported by Recommendation 12 (COR 1, LOE A).",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies this as a minor, non-disabling stroke and recommends early dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel, aligning with guidelines that favor DAPT over thrombolysis in this setting. The suggested 21-day DAPT course followed by single antiplatelet therapy is appropriate."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation develops sudden-onset right-sided weakness and aphasia at home. Emergency medical services arrive within 20 minutes of symptom onset. On exam, he has a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 14. A local primary stroke center is 10 minutes away while a comprehensive thrombectomy-capable stroke center is available but 55 minutes away by ground transport. How should prehospital transport be directed in this patient?","Based on the 2026 AHA guideline, this patient with suspected large vessel occlusion (NIHSS 14 with right-sided weakness and aphasia) should be transported to the local primary stroke center (PSC) 10 minutes away for rapid evaluation and initiation of intravenous thrombolysis, with subsequent interhospital transfer to the thrombectomy-capable center if needed, because the RACECAT trial and TRIAGE-STROKE trial demonstrated that in areas with well-coordinated systems of stroke care and local hospitals proficient in thrombolysis delivery, direct transport of patients with suspected LVO to a distant thrombectomy center approximately 45–60 minutes away does not improve 3-month clinical outcomes compared to transport to a local stroke center, and the guideline (Recommendation 4) explicitly states this finding, while also emphasizing (Recommendation 5) that hospitals and EMS professionals should establish agreements and protocols to prioritize interhospital transfer to reduce door-in–door-out times for patients needing a higher level of care such as endovascular thrombectomy.",0.0,"WRONG: The student addressed transport destination and did not address the reference point about tirofiban before EVT. The reference answer states there is no benefit to preoperative tirofiban in AIS with LVO, which is not mentioned or reflected in the student’s response."
"A 72 year old woman presents to the ED 4 hours after sudden onset of left sided weakness, aphasia, and rightward gaze deviation. On examination she has global aphasia and his NIH stroke Scale score is 19. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes in the right MCA territory. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the proximal right MCA  M1 segment. CT perfusion shows a large ischemic core with limited hypoperfused tissue. Given the large ischemic core, can endovascular thrombectomy be performed?","Yes, endovascular thrombectomy can still be performed because according to the 2026 guidelines, EVT is recommended for patients presenting within 6 hours with anterior circulation proximal LVO of the ICA or M1, NIHSS score ≥6, prestroke mRS 0–1, and ASPECTS as low as 3 (Recommendation 9 covers ASPECTS 3–10), and even for ASPECTS 0–2 EVT is considered reasonable in selected patients under 80 years without significant mass effect (Recommendation 11), recognizing that CT hypodensity and low cerebral blood flow estimates are predictors of infarction but not synonymous with entirely irreversible tissue loss, though the treatment benefit diminishes with larger cores and a threshold of ≥26 mL of severe CT hypodensity has been associated with no functional benefit and increased risks such as cerebral edema and need for hemicraniectomy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student affirms that EVT can still be performed despite a large ischemic core, aligning with evidence that supports expanding EVT eligibility to some large-core strokes. While they add extra specifics that are not required, the key factual conclusion matches the reference."
"A 68 year old man with a history of hypertension presents to the ED 3 hours after sudden onset of ride-sided weakness and slurred speech. On examination, he has a right facial droop and right arm weakness. His NIH Stroke Scale score is 9. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage and CT angiography reveals no large vessel occlusion. The patient is treated with intravenous thrombolysis and the stroke team debates whether adding an adjuvant antithrombotic agent might improve clinical outcomes. What is the most appropriate management decision?","Based on the 2026 AHA/ASA guideline, the most appropriate management decision is to **not** administer any adjunctive antithrombotic agent concurrently or within the early post-thrombolysis period, because the guidelines explicitly recommend against IV aspirin concurrently or within 90 minutes after IVT due to hemorrhage risk (COR 3: Harm, LOE B-R), recommend against adjunctive IV eptifibatide after IVT within 3 hours as it provides no benefit in reducing disability at 3 months (COR 3: No Benefit, LOE B-R), and the MOST trial demonstrated that adjunctive IV argatroban and eptifibatide after IVT did not reduce post-stroke disability but were associated with increased 90-day mortality; instead, aspirin should be deferred until at least 24 hours after thrombolysis once follow-up imaging has excluded intracranial hemorrhage, consistent with the standard practice of delaying antiplatelet therapy to maintain long-term prophylactic benefit while minimizing early hemorrhagic complications.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly recommends against adding adjuvant antithrombotic therapy (e.g., eptifibatide, argatroban) with IV thrombolysis, which matches the reference. They also appropriately note deferring antiplatelets until after follow-up imaging, consistent with standard practice."
"A 68-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is admitted for acute ischemic stroke after presenting with right-sided weakness and dysarthria. He arrives 3 hours after symptom onset and receives appropriate reperfusion therapy. During hospitalization in the stroke unit, point-of-care glucose measurements range from 180 to 220 mg/d and his stolic blood pressure ranges from 155 to 165 mm Hg.  Based on current stroke guidelines, how should this patient's blood glucose and blood pressure be managed?","Based on current 2026 AIS guidelines, this patient's hyperglycemia should **not** be treated with intensive IV insulin targeting 80–130 mg/dL, as Recommendation 5 states that in hospitalized AIS patients with hyperglycemia, IV insulin to achieve blood glucose levels of 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended to improve 3-month functional outcomes; however, blood glucose should still be monitored and reasonably managed (avoiding severe hypo- and hyperglycemia), and regarding blood pressure, since he received intravenous thrombolysis his BP should be maintained below 180/105 mmHg for at least the first 24 hours post-IVT (which his current systolic range of 155–165 mmHg satisfies), and intensive SBP reduction to a target of <140 mmHg is explicitly not recommended for mild-to-moderate severity AIS treated with IVT because it does not improve functional outcomes and, in the setting of successful endovascular recanalization, a target of <140 mmHg is considered potentially harmful.",1.0,CORRECT: The student accurately states that intensive glucose control to 80–130 mg/dL is not recommended and notes the risk of severe hypoglycemia. The additional blood pressure guidance is consistent with current stroke guidelines and does not conflict with the reference.
"A 12 year old previously healthy boy is brought to the ED after a sudden onset of right-sided weakness and difficulty speaking that began 90 minutes before arrival at school. On examination the patient is alert but has expressive aphasia. His NIH stroke scale score is 11. Non contrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage. CT angiography shows an occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery, m1 segment. How should this patient’s stroke be managed according to current guidelines?","According to current guidelines, this 12-year-old boy with confirmed acute ischemic stroke due to left MCA M1 occlusion presenting within 6 hours of symptom onset should be managed with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) performed by an experienced neurointerventionalist to improve functional outcomes (COR 2a for patients ≥6 years with large vessel occlusion within 6 hours), and IV thrombolysis with alteplase may also be considered (COR 2b for pediatric patients aged 28 days to 18 years with confirmed AIS within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, though efficacy is uncertain), given that his presentation at 90 minutes is well within both the 4.5-hour IVT and 6-hour EVT treatment windows, his NIHSS score of 11 indicates significant neurological deficits, and imaging confirms a proximal large vessel occlusion without hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies endovascular thrombectomy as appropriate for a pediatric large-vessel occlusion within the treatment window, aligning with guidelines that support interventional therapy in select children. Mention of considering IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours is also consistent with guideline allowances and does not contradict the reference."
A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension develops sudden onset of left-sided weakness and slurred speech while at home. A mobile stroke unit (MSU) and conventional emergency services are both available and can be deployed immediately. What emergency service is preferred?,"Based on the guidelines, a mobile stroke unit (MSU) is preferred because MSUs have been shown to improve functional outcomes at 90 days, reduce onset-to-treatment times, increase the proportion of patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis within the critical golden hour, and achieve significantly faster thrombolysis compared to conventional EMS care, with no identified safety concerns regarding all-cause mortality, stroke mimics treated with IVT, or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student identifies the MSU as preferred when available and supports this with evidence of faster treatment and improved outcomes, consistent with the reference. The added details do not contradict the guideline and align with reported benefits and safety."
"A 54-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to the emergency department 3 hours after sudden onset of left-sided weakness, gaze deviation, and decreased level of alertness. On examination, he has dense left hemiplegia and neglect, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 22. Noncontrast head CT shows early ischemic changes involving more than one half of the right middle cerebral artery territory. Should intravenous glibenclamide be initiated?","No, intravenous glibenclamide should not be initiated, because the CHARM trial demonstrated that IV glibenclamide for cerebral edema after large hemispheric infarction did not result in improved functional outcome at 90 days (cOR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.80–1.71]; P=0.42) nor reduce 90-day mortality, and the 2026 guideline explicitly states that in patients with large hemispheric infarction aged 18 to 70 years, the use of IV glibenclamide does not result in improved functional outcome and is not recommended.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student clearly states that IV glibenclamide should not be initiated for large hemispheric infarction in adults 18–70 because it does not improve functional outcomes, aligning with Class III (No Benefit) recommendations. The added trial rationale is consistent and does not contradict the guideline."
"A 73-year-old woman is admitted after an acute ischemic stroke involving the right hemispheric region. After initial stabilization, she is noted to have difficulty swallowing, frequent coughing during oral intake, and a wet-sounding voice. A bedside swallow evaluation is abnormal, and a subsequent videofluoroscopic swallow study confirms moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration of thin liquids. According to current stroke guidelines, how should dysphagia be managed in this patient?","According to current stroke guidelines, this patient's dysphagia should be managed through a multimodal approach: first, a bedside swallow screening should have been performed prior to any oral intake (which was appropriately done here), and given the confirmed moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia with aspiration, oral intake of thin liquids should be restricted with diet modifications guided by the videofluoroscopic findings; pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) can be beneficial to reduce dysphagia severity and decrease the risk of aspiration (Recommendation 17); an oral hygiene protocol should be implemented to reduce pneumonia risk; nutritional screening using validated tools should be performed preferably within 48 hours of admission to direct nutritional management; if the patient cannot safely swallow, a nasogastric tube should be used for enteral feeding within the first 7 days, with consideration of percutaneous gastrostomy only if the anticipated inability to swallow safely extends beyond 2–3 weeks; and enteral diet should be initiated within 7 days of admission to ensure adequate nutritional support, as malnourished patients demonstrate significantly increased risk for death or poor outcomes.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student explicitly includes pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES) as beneficial to reduce dysphagia severity and aspiration risk, which is the key guideline recommendation. The additional management details are extraneous but not contradictory to the reference."
"A 69-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation presents to the emergency department 2 hours after sudden onset of right-sided weakness and aphasia. On examination, he has dense right hemiparesis and expressive aphasia, with a NIH Stroke Scale score of 17. Noncontrast head CT shows no intracranial hemorrhage, and CT angiography reveals an occlusion of the left proximal middle cerebral artery, M1 segment. He is an appropriate candidate for endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). How should the use of tirofiban be approached in this patient?","Based on the 2026 guidelines, preoperative administration of tirofiban before EVT is not useful to improve 90-day functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke in the setting of large vessel occlusion (Recommendation 14), and this is supported by the RESCUE-BT trial which found no functional benefit from IV preoperative tirofiban in LVO prior to EVT, so tirofiban should not be administered to this patient before proceeding with endovascular thrombectomy.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student accurately states that preoperative tirofiban before EVT in AIS with LVO does not improve 90-day functional outcomes and should not be given, aligning with the COR 3: No Benefit recommendation."
"A 63-year-old man with no prior neurologic disability (baseline mRS score of 0) is brought to the emergency department after sudden onset of vertigo, diplopia, dysarthria, and progressive weakness that began 6 hours earlier. On arrival, his NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score is 18 and PC-Apsects 7. How should this patient be managed?","Based on the 2026 guidelines, this patient—with acute ischemic stroke due to presumed basilar artery occlusion, a baseline mRS of 0, NIHSS score of 18 (≥10), PC-ASPECTS of 7 (≥6), and presentation within 24 hours of symptom onset—meets the criteria outlined in Recommendation 13, and therefore endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is recommended to achieve better functional outcomes and reduce mortality, alongside standard medical management including consideration of intravenous thrombolysis if otherwise eligible.",1.0,"CORRECT: The student appropriately recommends endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours for basilar artery occlusion with baseline mRS 0, NIHSS ≥10, and PC-ASPECTS ≥6 to improve outcomes and reduce mortality. The added note on considering IV thrombolysis does not contradict the reference."
"A 67-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department 18 hours after sudden onset of left arm weakness and mild slurred speech that resolved within 30 minutes. On arrival, her neurologic examination shows only subtle left hand clumsiness. Her NIH Stroke Scale score is 3. Brain MRI shows a small acute infarct in the right frontal cortex. CT angiography shows 70% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery. Cardiac monitoring and echocardiography show no evidence of marital fibrillation or other cardioembolic source. She did not receive intravenous thrombolysis. How should this patient’s antiplatelet therapy be managed?","This patient presents with a minor noncardioembolic acute ischemic stroke (NIHSS score of 3, ≤3) who did not receive intravenous thrombolysis and is within 24 hours of symptom onset, which aligns with the criteria established by the CHANCE and POINT trials; therefore, according to Recommendation 12 (COR 1, LOE A), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin should be initiated early — typically with a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg plus aspirin 162–325 mg followed by daily clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 75–100 mg — and continued for 21 days to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke, after which she should be transitioned to single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), and if pharmacogenomic testing reveals she carries the CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele, dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor and aspirin for 21 days may be a reasonable alternative per Recommendation 15 (COR 2b, LOE B-R).",1.0,"CORRECT. The student recommends starting dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin for 21 days followed by single antiplatelet therapy, which matches the guideline-based approach for minor noncardioembolic stroke with significant atherosclerotic stenosis when IVT was not given. Additional details on loading doses and a ticagrelor option do not contradict the reference."
